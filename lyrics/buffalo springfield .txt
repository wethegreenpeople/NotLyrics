Out of my mind
And I just can't take it anymore
Left behind
By myself and what I'm living for

All I hear is screams
From outside the limousines
That are taking me

Out of my mind
Through the keyhole in an open door
Happy to find
That I don't know what I'm smiling for

Tired of hanging on
If you've missed me, I've just gone
'Cause they're taking me

Out of my mind
Da, da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da, da

Out of my mind
And I just can't take it anymore
Left behind
By myself and what I'm living for

All I hear is screams
From outside the limousines
That are taking me
Out of my mindDo I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

If it was a game I could play it
Trying to make it but I'm losing time
I got to bring you in, you're overworking my mind

Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she cared

Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared once before

Do I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she cared

Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared once before

Do I have to come right out and say it girl?
Tell you that you look so fine
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

If it was a game I could play it
Trying to make it but I'm losing time
I got to bring you in, you're overworking my mind

Do I have to come right out and say it girl?
Tell you that you look so fineWhen the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane
Like a smoke ring day when the wind blows

Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now

In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a chance to see through me

Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?

Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now? YesBeen burned and with both feet on the ground
I've learned that it's painful coming down

No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm findin' out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'

Flashed, and I think I'm fallin' down
Crashed, and my ears can hear a sound

No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm findin' out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'

Now I'm findin' out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'

Burned and with both feet on the ground
Been burned and with both feet on the ground
I've learned that it's painful comin' down

No use runnin' away, and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm findin' out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'Listen to my song
It isn't very long
You'll see before I'm gone
That everybody's wrong

Those of us who run
To catch a moment in the sun
Seem to find the when we're done
That we weren't supposed to run

And there's to many words going down
Babe wrecking against the walls with the hollow sound
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you see
It ain't million, you and me not a crown

Finding what you sought
After all the time you fought
Sometimes leave's you with the thought
That perhaps you just been caught

And there's to many words going down
Babe wrecking against the walls with the hollow sound
All about what it's going to be
Yes, you know what it was you see
It ain't million, you and me not a crown

Finding what you sought
After all the time you fought
Sometimes leave's you with the thought
That perhaps you just been caughtThere's a woman that you ought to know
And she's coming, singing soft and low
Singing rock and roll, she's a joy to know

'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand
I am free there, just to make my plans
Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand
And she will follow me wide, do you know
Familiar places she's been by, that I know

Could it be, she don't have to try
And tomorrow, she's a friend of mine
And the sorrow, I see her face is lined
She's no longer blind, she's just hard to findOut of my mind
And I just can't take it anymore
Left behind
By myself and what I'm living for
All I hear are screams from outside the Limousines
That are taking me
Out of my mind

Left behind

All I hear are screams from outside the Limousines
That are taking me
Out of my mindOh, hello Mr. Soul
I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head
Is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face
Could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change
But a stranger is putting the tease on

I was down on a frown,
When the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan
Who said I upset her
Any girl in the world
Could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange
But don't change", and I let her

In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?

Broken Arrow
The lights turned on and the curtain fell down, 
And when it was over it felt like a dream, 
They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream, 
The agents had paid for the black limousine 
That waited outside in the rain. 
Did you see them, did you see them? 
Did you see them in the river? 
They were there to wave to you. 
Could you tell that the empty quivered, 
Brown skinned Indian on the banks 
That were crowded and narrow, 
Held a broken arrow? 

Eighteen years of American dream, 
He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall. 
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall, 
His mother had told him a trip was a fall, 
And don't mention babies at all. 
Did you see him, did you see him? 
Did you see him in the river? 
He was there to wave to you. 
Could you tell that the empty quivered, 
Brown skinned Indian on the banks 
That were crowded and narrow, 
Held a broken arrow? 

The streets were lined for the wedding parade, 
The Queen wore the white gloves, the county of song, 
The black covered caisson her horses had drawn 
Protected her King from the sun rays of dawn. 
They married for peace and were gone. 
Did you see them, did you see them? 
Did you see them in the river? 
They were there to wave to you. 
Could you tell that the empty quivered, 
Brown skinned Indian on the banks 
That were crowded and narrow, 
Held a broken arrow?Listen to my bluebird laugh
She can't tell you why
Deep within her heart, you see
She knows only crying, just crying

There she sits, aloft a perch
Strangest color blue
Flying is forgotten now
Thinks only of you, just you, oh yeah

So get all those blues
Must be a thousand hues
And be just differently used
You just know

You sit there mesmerized
By the depth of her eyes
That you can't categorize
She got soul, she got soul
She got soul, she got soul

Do you think she loves you?
Do you think at all?

Soon she's going to fly away
Sadness is her own
Give herself a bath of tears
And go home and go homeWell there goes another day
Now I wonder why
You and I, keep telling lies

I can't believe that what you say
'Cause tomorrows lullaby can't pacify
My lonesome crying

Make believe that's all you know
And to make believe is a game
A child's rein, you've changed your name

So sadly I watched the show
I watched you became, truth is the shame
Yeah, too much painYou ask me to read this letter
That you wrote the night before
And you really should know better
'Cause she's worth a whole lot more

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries?
Is that why you won't go and say goodbye?

Then you said the fault was yours
And you really were to blame
It was as if to close the doors
And to hide away in shame

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries?
Is that why you won't go and say goodbye?

Yes, and why, tell me why
Can't you see that it's not right?
It's a lie, it's a lie
Don't hide your sorrow in the night

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries?
Is that why you won't go and say goodbye?

And I know the pain is double
But for her it's even worse
You must face her with the trouble
'Though it's hurting like a curse

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries?
Is that why you won't go and say goodbye?

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries?
Is that why you won't go and say, gonna go and say
Gonna go and say goodbye?Sit down, I think I love you
Anyway I'd like to try
I can't stop thinking of you
If you go I know I cry

Can't you see that I'm a desperate man
I can hide, just bein' around
You want to know
What they say about the bird in my hand
And that's why I ain't leavin' without you

So if you want someone to love you
Pretty baby, I'm your guy
It's not much I'm askin' of you
Just a please give me a try

Can't you see that I'm a desperate man
I can hide, just bein' around
You want to know
What they say about the bird in my hand
And that's why I ain't leavin' without you

So if you want someone to love you
Pretty baby, I'm your guy
It's not much I'm askin' of you
Just a please give me a try

Sit down, I think I love you
Sit down, I think I love you
Sit down, I think I love you
Sit down, I think I love youBeen burned and with both feet on the ground
I've learned that it's painful comin' down

No use runnin' away and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'

Flashed and I think I'm fallin' down
Flashed and I think I'm fallin' down
Crashed and my ears can't hear a sound

No use runnin' away and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'

Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'

Burned and with both feet on the ground
Burned and with both feet on the ground
I've learned that it's painful comin' down

No use runnin' away and there's no time left to stay
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusin'
No time left and I know I'm losin'Soft winds blow in the summertime
Young lovers feel so free
Walking hand in hand down a shady lane
What happened to me? What happened to me?

Did you ever love a girl
Who walked right out on you?
You should know just how I feel then
Why I'm so blue, why I'm so blue

How can I forget those nights
When she kissed me soft and true
And whispered words only lovers know
Oh, I love you, oh, I love you

Well, I've made up my mind, I'll find a new girl
Who'll love me tenderly
Forget the past I've left behind now
To a sad memory, to a sad memory

Soft winds blow in the summertimeThere's a woman that you ought to know
And she's coming, singing soft and low
Singing rock n' roll, she's a joy to know

'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand
I am free there just to make my plans
Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand

And she will follow me wide, do you know
Familiar places she's been by, that I know
Could it be, she don't have to try

And tomorrow, she's a friend of mine
And the sorrow, I see her face is lined
She's no longer blind, she's just hard to findIn the hour of not quite rain
When the fog was fingertip high
The moon hung suspended
In a singular sky

Deeply and beyond seeing
Not wishing to intrude
Bathed in its own reflection
The water mirrored the moon

The tumbling birds have now sobered
From the leaves of their nursery
Like shadowy, quiet children
Watching sleepilyI got a good reason for loving you
It's an old fashioned sign
I kinda get the feelin' like mmm, you know when
I fell in love the first time

Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes
Kind woman don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right

Remember once before hearing the old folks say
Love's an ageless old rhyme
But now a days you know the sayin' depends so much on
The kind of woman that you find

Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes
Kind woman don't leave me lonely tonight
Please say it's all right

Kind woman, won't you love me tonight?
The look in your eyes

Please say it's all rightYou ask me to read this letter

Don't hide your sorrow in the night

Is that why you won't go and say
Gonna go and say, gonna go and say "Goodbye"?There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly saying, "Hooray for our side"

It's time we stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the men come and take you away

We better stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

Stop
Hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

Stop
Now, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

Stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?There's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear

Stop
Children, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?Do I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?
If it was a game I could play it
Trying to make it but I'm losing time
I got to bring you in, you're overworking my mind
Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she cared
Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared once before
Do I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

If it was a game I could play it
Trying to make it but I'm losing time
I got to bring you in, you're overworking my mind
Do I have to come right out and say it girl?
Tell you that you look so fineWho's that stomping all over my face
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy before she's begun
To singing in the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joinin' and listenin' and talkin' in rhymes
Stoppin' the feeling to wait for the times

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

And who's all hung-up on that happiness thing
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score
Who's trying to act like he's just in between
The line isn't black, if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be

And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five
Who's got the feeling that he came alive
Though havin' it, sharin' it ain't quite the same
It ain't no gold nugget, you can't lay a claim
Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor
There it is baby, don't you worry no more
Who should be sleepin', but is writing this song
Wishin' and a-hopin' he weren't so damned wrongThere's something happening here
But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware
