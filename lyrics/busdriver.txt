We do not have the lyrics for Do The Wop yet.(with The Pulmonary Palimpsest)

-(they paint their vulva) beige, bleed a cola keg, while i plan to ruin GOP motor cades.
part these senseless zines, turned censored scenes, i earn a soldiers wage,
so i broke your legs, threw your roller blades, cuz you claimed that the OG was overpaid,
for pointin' M-16's at grenadines, coursing thru the pollster aid,
i need my water brush, in the economic crunch, the financers are seeped in embalming slush,
on the sexist machine, express the means to re-appeal Roe vs Wade,
so i gotta de mode, the dark matter, on the spring loaded park plaza,
who is in charge, I don't know, they all eat their business cards

-(I'm a hack at deer) shootin' know Vladimir Putin,
while i wear this cashmere pant suit thing,
i can knight the spokesman, so Ibuprophen, becomes your golden egg
(automated) voter readytellers are the subsequent heavy seller, in the pool of undecided registry,
-cuz they don't give a fuck about the findings on a troop surge, it's a moot point what have you heard
(bumbling) idiots for news correspondents see the desperate need for a new foreign policy,
-yet they give credence to the pig war pandering, as we all squabble for Saturn's rings
(regimented) double talk under cuts the pertinence of (corporate) heads tryin' to runaway with tax cuts
-(investi)bles the evangelicals are tent poles beggin' the head of state de regulate the gross
(happy ever)after benefactors all settle matters, (the senate)gatters to celebrate the fat fucks
-(inabili)ty to give a single solitary hoot about the (prola)teriate their merriment is gross

-(your niggas looking) gid up, rolling in a Prius, (but i gotta) give my money management a C plus,
with my foreclosed home, an' pork bowl loans, i revisit the need to grind,
-(i'm dating Russian) fem-bots, sipping on hem lock (cuz i got) overdue billings on my desktop,
-(when i've been) overthought an' undercooked, that' s when i need me time

-watch the bank merge liberal thinker cuz now the middle fingers the California stat bird.Me and you in love with our
Rule over solid waste
Our artistic merit is questionable
We'll fall on our face
And I can't bare the sight
Not to sound pragmatic
But our parents were right
This ain't adequate
But you can always seek refuge under…

Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Return to the bourgeoisie while I sift through debris

You view the poverty line as a threshold
For truth in pricey slums
This ain't art school, it's a shark pool
Of well-groomed yuppie scum
And they got orders to kill
Watch them fashion your cell
How'd they get a recording deal
When they're wack as hell
But the chicken-scratch in your sketch book
It mirrors what you loath

Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers

They got easels to stain, and uh
People to blame, with their
Egos inflamed, and their
Neat codenames
I saw your sub-genre in a passing glance
It was you and your DJ in matching pants

Sleeping pills and record sleeves
Defaced museum pieces
Concert-goers flailing arms
Taxidermy for the nouveau riche

I don't need this
I don't need this…

Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Sunshowers
I don't need this, I don't need this
SunshowersWhoo!
Art rap, art rap, art rap, art rap!
Whoo!

Who better qualified to mediate in the larp discord/
With my dewy moleskin brewing cauldron and karmic orb/
I'm fully pantsless like the wooly mammoth from the tar pit gorge/
Yet I'm David Carradine taking thorazine off the starship oars/
No godhead in the blog thread stringing this harpsichord/
No tasteful tunes, just tablespoons of parsnip porridge/
Of the bleeded ether from the Greenpeacer's alarmist lore/

(Chorus)
I'm dashing and windblown/
When the world's agape/
And I bookend your smiles with unhappy endings/
I'm dashing and windblown/
When the world's agape/

Drop orange rind on the war crime set in the crowded ballot/
With my in-laws and Limbaugh singing a power ballad/
Their price gouging funds their night outings and flowered phallice/
More than spider bites we give them writer's strikes and an endowed outage/
The ulcer gargle and dulcimer drone are character-driven/
Like the "no sir" art show, sulfur marble and American women/
This bonus disk shows my showmanship and parenting acumen/

(Chorus)
I'm dashing and windblown/
When the world's agape/
And I bookend your smiles with unhappy endings/
I'm dashing and windblown/
When the world's agape/
Oh what to do/

Oh what to do when the world we service is a whirling dervish/
And my sidekick aids his surly cervix he's burly and girlish/
And I'm Isaac Hayes on a gurney in Zurich saying/
"Man up puss! Right now!"/
We're telling kids/
"Oh yes, you can't"/

I'm rushed to hair and make-up on the war-torn beachfront/
Where I narrate stuff like a foreign-born creampuff/
But I forewarn the teen pups that their core's worn and pre-shrunk/
Then in poor form, I triple lutz and I land on my gristle hump/
But really/
I'm into spooning and spoonerisms/
And I make a splash like my hands are two-thirds fish fin/
Because when I talk it's like nuclear fission yet it resonates/
Like a Ferris Bueller ditch party/
Apply the oil-slick sheen of the Blue Man Group/
Eat Soylent Green by the two-hand scoop/
When you see my face at the newsstand booth/
With plutonium in his thermos/
I got Obi-Wan discharged/
With my phony gun and lip service/
I earned the large gift card/
To stir up the stern class kings and nurture the saplings/

I earn medals dirt-pedal with the facial hair of Burt Reynolds/
Burnt kettles on my turntables/
Make sheet music leak coolant/
When I speak to it/Yeah yeah a-yeah a-yeah
Hey, let me talk to these people
Ey, I got the 20-something rap guy anthem right here in my hands y'all check it out
It's for you young buck, or old buck, or middle-aged buck
Whatever

You got a face like an imperiled vagina
You're from a Carolina
[?] name has a umlaut and parentheses
You embody foot and mouth disease
So it's right that you write a book about MCs
It's like, cheers

Chorus:
Here's To Us
And all the nothing that we promised to do
Here's To Us
Who else is gonna be the son is with you
It's clear enough
We're near the cusp
Of a long-encompassing
Stroke of genius

I need you to leave
Peeves
We've had enough of your shit well should we help you?

Cuz I spit butane uh
Is it inhumane if I uh
Just get a few things

Yeah
I'm in stores with engorged grocery lists
I ain't buying I'm scratching off my homies' shit
A weeknight's a rewrite of Moby Dick
I sleep tight and dreaming hearing pre-flight safety tips
My room smells of steamed rice and baby shit
Cuz I'm consumed with what gets played through the cross fader
How ya mean I'm Lebron James of the Bronze Age
Renaissance nigga [?] ball play
I missed a job in the views of movie sets
The vaporized weed with a jacuzzi jet
Cuz now I won't be the spokes man and for booty sweat
And break character for school I'm an anti-socialite
On karaoke night I request Deep Purple
It makes my sacra complete though it's a semi-circle
But the dance floor's a class war dress rehearsal
I won't stand for it
I'm sipping Merlot in the first row like, cheers

Chorus

Oh!
My personal unemployment rate is cringeworthy
And my party don't stop until about a six a thirty
In the morning I break it in the afternoons with my dick dirty
Knowing I'll be dead and famous before I hit thirty
But if I studied I could have been a neurosurgeon
Instead me and my band are busy circle jerking
Squeezing out a stroke of genius for rights to our intellectual properties are gonna need more subpoenas
They're like
You should make a mixtape
You should make a sextape
For all the hater and bottlers that slept late
I'll write a screenplay
Yeah, that'll be the day
The musings of Tina Fey become a personal [?]
Oops
When I say cheesy shit the CD skips
My MP3s are 10ccs are pretense
So sing my praises with your teeth clenched
On smart phones that speak French
My songs are going for three pence
Sucker!
But you said you killed over a song
Now you write tunes that you need a vocoder on
I'm trying to retire to Boca Raton
And escape the business end of the popo's baton
And like, cheers

Chorus

This one's for us
Not you
Even though we know you well
At least we did in the 90s
We don't like you anymore
YeahWe do not have the lyrics for Skit yet.I’m at the currency exchange with an armored guard wearing a
Motherfucking penguin suit
You know I can’t keep the bank in the loop
They underestimate the value of my language soup
What I’m exactly paid so I tax evade
I’ve manufactured every single black cliché but I’ve got a problem
I don’t know how to raise children
I just know how to raise money
Without a percentage being withheld
Without giving any to strippers who sniff rails
I can sell anything, split a cell
Give gigabytes of military intel
To any government that doesn’t kiss and tell
Then write a musical starring Kim Cattrall
In general my money’s long, long gone
That’s why I’m selling DVD’s in Hong Kong
With a sad face oblong, I’m selling Pennywise shirts at the Warped tour
Until I’m a Saudi Arabian warlord
I mean… I’ll kill puppies and deforest
To get a plate of food from that smorgasbord
‘Cuz right now motherfuckers eat bleached orchids
I think I need some reinforcements
Somebody other than Dr. Spock cuz I’m raising an awkward tot
Who doesn’t understand that her father’s not
Able to pay that steep mortgage
In a rat race I couldn’t beat a tortoise
And I can’t afford to pay my keyboardist due to extreme poorness
Can somebody out there tell me what a motherfucking D chord is
Now I just spit hot game ‘til my teeth taste like shell casings
My hustle approach is hell raising
I’m selling local businesses Yelp ratings
Siphoning the run-off from the sewage treatment plant in Tijuana
And I’m selling it to women in Beverly Hills as drinking water
Now I’m so rich nigga I could eat an Iguana
I may not know anything
But I know everything
Man I don’t know shit
I’m your dip shit, I’m your lazy bum
I could get rich on the training run
I don’t know a thing about this enriched uranium
I’ll blow a hole in this voting pole so smoke a pole
And bread me out like I was an Arod or BasedGod
Have execs jumping up like tased frogs
Or I’m in the hospital breaking into several file cabinets
Taking the identity of dead patience then filing for medical malpractice
Y’all show a bias towards the manufacturers of cyborgs
Not grandmothers on ironing boards or past leaders of Vice lords
I’m outlining my meal plan
By showing how my flow’s so silly
Because what you offer is real bland
And tastes just like hobo chilli
I may not know anything
But I know everything
And I thought that my daughter could do anything
There’s an airforce on her tongue
And there’s an overdue bill on my mind
And there’s a million dollars in a song of mine
And there’s a lack of love in being on the grind
I give it to you on your darkest days
To fill that gapping hole that came with that garnished wage
You ask me when does the pain stop
I don’t know man my home address is stageplotHello, I'm conducting a survey, and I have some questions to ask you, first off

Do you have a fear of a black tangent?
Were you born in the year of the rat?
Do you cheer and clap,
When weird rap bands commence?
I can tell by your answer you'll probably frolic with me in the foot hills
And that you want your tofu patty cooked, not grilled
But it doesn't matter, you've been enticed
And drawn in with my hook and reel

Oprah nods by novels
As you can see it sells very ("promenably") in Denver Colorodo

LOL Laugh out loud
You've never known hell so well
Until you've identified with a black crowd
It's a fear of a black tangent idiot
A public enemy spoof
Now some of your friends will reboot
The computer and do a google search
And be discouraged when they find out that the truth will hurt
When they see that I am not their zeitgiest
Nor am I christ-like
Nor do I dislike whites
I just want a better chance
Cause most likely I'll sell more records in France


-SPACmikeGo slow, fall like shadows
Perfect shapeless shape shifter
Earth, it glows
Heart is sowing
Galaxy awaits you; gate swung open

Go slow, fall like shadows
Perfect, shapeless shape shifter

You should hold those splintered bones
Spare your exhausted glands
Go slow, trace breath
Leap into these large unpromised hands
Mutter those Ginsberg poems
Cool those worn hooves
Go slow, face your death
Walk into the fiery orange woods

Go slow, fall like shadows
Perfect, shapeless shape shifter
Earth, it glows
Heart is sowing
Galaxy awaits you; gate swung open

Go slow, fall like shadows
Perfect, shapeless shape shifterBe real, conscious rap failed us

And in saying that

You know, welcome to my rap jam

The top-hatted Abrahams are shoveling the raisin bran
In eyeballs their bi-laws are leaping off the laser scan
Onto your genotype telling you to deepthroat that pipe
If you don't do it well
These hoes might
The red carpenter's quota fills the deficit in motor skills
Of on-lookers raw sugars register at overkill
Within your colon wall so a candied bowling ball
You squeeze out at the open call
But what if you could
Inundate the open hearing with your shrewd barbs
That perforates the sloganeering on the cue cards
Would you prize that fine cut or just apply blush
As besquelched sea-kelp nibbling on pie crust
The job offers at Albany's count Dracula
And calorie-count spatula kitchen staff
Are on the lithograph
Of your Calvin Kline alkaline-enriched gonads
Should I kiss your ass or screw you
In the saffron soy dip
But my Zaxxon joy stick pokes at my
Glitter spackled tight jump suit
Mr. Applewhite grunt pukes
From the candle light-drunk seldom sung tooth
But you're the fresh faced unknown
With sophomoric gags and washboard abs
Finding cinaplex waste blood stones
Can I be OG Mud Bone?
Go free and unplug the phone

Nannies or swamis undefeated
Screaming "Pansy commies! Love it or leave it"
Or pumping antibodies in the VP's cleavage
They split it, split it...

Nannies or swamis undefeated

Cool points trump those DIY Numerics

Be yourself but I'm too embarrassed
You got to be you
So that famed crook playbook and diary diarrhea split seconds
Split seconds, they split seconds, split seconds...

The 1-800 dollar guilt trip
Stamped on my African name book
Proves that behind the cumulus blue
There's a humilicious stew as
Dane Cook's table reads, so I yank butch's anal beads
Out of the clenched bum of PG rated test runs
Stuffing YouTube viewership up deviated septum's
Between two choose your pick:
Rule Zimbabwe or
Improved computer chips become your new Yahweh
Boo-hoo loser bitch your dopes in the blood and stole
Because most rap careers mirror stints as drug mules
But you are the pickaninny, blackfaced Ren & Stimpy
Our on-screen time is split 50-50
But I've only drawn guns 
On construction paper with the pastel sticks
And I'm a left of center loyalist 
Who's selling bean pies with a bad sales pitch
This sex offender's foil fixed in utero
On my own dumb ass self
Yeah I pimp super ho
Whom is me
They liken Driver to Fish Bone
Have fire and brimstone misers disowned
But I'm not sure
Y'all are too NAACP or NWA on GP
But I straddle the fence every nanosec
Canceled checks line the uteral wall of my music hall

Cool points trump those DIY numerics

Be yourself, but I'm too embarrassed
You got to be you
So that famed crook playbook and diary diarrhea split seconds
Split seconds, they split seconds, split seconds...Buy my posthumous full-length
My colorfully packaged disembodied shriek
Converted to ring tones used in car ads
Sung by winged gnomes over the head of Dick Clark
Cover pages graced by the chiseled hard abs
Of this now charred slab of dead pop diva
Recreated as the head of Biz Mark
Spliced on top of Hello Kitty
On a virtual land mass with a hip-kink
It's lip-synched to my song and committed to telecine
And the nothing left of me is left to bask in a camera flash

I've never been so successful 'till I died
And my label wished my heavenly chariot
Pre-board defunct
I didn't die in a hail of gunfire
I died doing extreme sports at a resort
On a bungee cord on a ski jump
No need to ask how a dead rapper can be a label's cash cow
They just record me months before on G-funk string chords
Add an R&B; chorus
Hit a keyboard key to punch
Even though I'm dead

I was booked on a fortnight
To exhaust notes dressed like a cockroach
Now I'm cooked and ate with a fork and knife
As your reheated pop sensation

I'm framed under a caption reading "prog-rap"
And given open-handed god smacks
By partisan zealots who not only think I draft-dodged Iraq
But that my back catalog is wack
And for it I should be flogged and smacked
But little do they know I'm dead already
And their complaints are small and petty
My autopsy was broadcast and shot on a webcam
I'm a dead man with golden blood in my bedpan

But still my pop song climbs
And you can buy it when you shop online
Prop my lifeless body up next to the podium as I accept applause
I'm an award-winning dead dude
With a tour pending and a celebrity love interest
I signed a movie deal to play a starring role
The film crew doesn't even suspect I'm dead
I'm your own martyr
I'm dead but don't unplug my phone chargerWe do not have the lyrics for Colour Wheel yet.[Verse 1: Busdriver]
We rub elbows with the super rich
Showing up exuberance
We futurists, we shoot the shit
So we need our computer fixed
My people's for the usefulness (that's why)
I'm surrounded by millionaires
The OG cliques and class
No opiates en masse, we scoping craps
I'm surrounded by millionaires
But they stitch flags with dishrags
Kick a jab [?] a prick with a badge [?]

[Hook: Busdriver]
I'm surrounded by millionaires
We making millions
No we made a millions
There's no difference
We breaking ceilings

[Post-Hook: Busdriver]
When I kill the game, it's not murder
I [?] suspicious and the cops murmur [?]
The push the border of the blocks further
So they mythologize the [?] earners
My squadron ain't hot rhymin [?]
[?]
Niggas just like us

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Chinchilla skin grafts, full-length
Except for the bear's feet stitched to the bare feet
And when I bare teeth it's carrots
Fuck floss, boss up, nigga or be tossed off
Or refuse to the beat, breasts fuse
Like the motherfucker let loose
Never been a hoozie, 'scuse me (blah)
Two times (blah, blah)
Come up off of everything you got up in the backpack bae bae
Give me fifty feet I'll walk a mile, follow
Give me fifty cents I make it rain by tomorrow
Swallowed every pill I'm on a million while you talking
Keeping it one hundred nigga what you really feeling
In age with the odds of a black astronaut were astronomical
We turned whips into spaceships
Found a place in between a nightmare and a dream to build castles, don't mind if they makeshift
Motherfucker we make shit
Revolution's an industry, who the fuck makes it ?
We can taste it
Betting like a bitch but I bet you don't know when the bass hit
Born a basehead
It's a birthright
Let it kick and ensnare in the first fight
Grab a mic get the first slice spit a verse like it's life on the line
And a hearse right behind her waiting with doors ajar
Shoot whatever it was sworn ima sport the car
And skirt the block and watch for skirts
And cop the gat and rock the ice and freeze the frame and trace the plot
Embrace the end inevitable
Endeavor to get the cheddar inevitable
But never amenable
Spit ever letter with the tenor of a venerable boss on the backs of millions
I don't look at the costI came here to titty twist saliva glands
So place your bets, save your breath and hissy fit firebrand
I can’t entertain these eery rock’n’roll staples
Like spendthrift, I spin discs on periodical tables
Take the basejump that makes you barf Wheathins
Your showreel’s bone meal under the stage lights
My everyday’s a coming-o-age cunt’s carpe diem
And this is why I treat LA like…
She my bottom bitch, cuz you my bottom bitch
Its safe to say what you think I’m saying’s a crock of shit
Because we fight a lot like this was Gaza Strip
But you my bottom bitch watch me make these chocolate chips
You my bottom bitch, why you my bottom bitch?
Because you think I’m the source of all awesomeness
So be my bottom bitch come and be my bottom bitch
I look good in print so I keep the desk light always on
Here’s a glimpse into the sexlife of automatons
My every evening is an M night Shyamalan
Lackluster ending where I spend nights at Comiccon
I ain’t from here, I’m from some ragtag ferris wheel
I blew the horn ‘cuz you were born smack dab in squaresville
For a limited time you get to view the purple lotus
Plus I give soulseekers that Youtuberculosis
Y’all polish wood and just leave a sleek finish
But I’ll score Bollywood when my mood piece is finished
I don’t acknowledge hoods I eat good and speak Finish
With secret sects on Meet the Press yet please the left and tease cynics
Teen sex and free clinics is your town’s greatest resource
As if falling off’s a motherfucking resource
So I entertain the young star baby gaga grudge match which tugs at
The lumbar ganglia, so I’m hunchbacked
You my bottom botch, LA you my bottom bitch
To love me your heart most be bottomless
But to me you are precious, I’m on some Gollum shit
But you my bottom bitch from top to the bottom bitch
You my bottom bitch, yes you are
Them other niggas don’t hustle they just cotton pick
But me honey, I bathe in lava pits
You can not take the budgetary woes so your live band’s on a charter bus
Openers get poked with spurs screaming ‘I am Spartacus’
I put a fine comb to the flightplan of you starter-ups
They need rides home when I’m in Iceland in armored trucks
Rolling up to places on that VIP shit
Head’s swivel, I wet my whistle with these ice tea sips
You’ll offer me a loaf of bread a cot and a sofa bed
Cuz your scene’s dying in need of an IV drip
And I’m Chinese medicine, you guys need to headspin
Yet nine times out of ten this LA tea party swabs balls
So I’m Lee Harvey Oswald with a call time
Fall in line yougin’ because I’m posted at the speedtrap
I’ve been here so long my nigga that I bleed tree sap
You overdressed sleestaks rap with swollen urinary tracks
You’re very wack, give me my scene backBuy my posthumous full-length

I should just (get up)
And treat these itchy bedsores
(get up) to making my indie-cred soar
(get up) my witty thread bores your kiddy pool party
(get up) this self-absorbed crowd is dumb and foolhardy
(get up) to face that's like a homepage
(get up) in a day as long as the stone age
(get up) I'm a quadruped pulling your dogsled
(get up) Yet in my mind we are all dead(all dead, all dead, all dead)

Hey, I'm always telling them to (get up)

Your retro hair band's gonna blow up
Cuz gay is the new black
And when you stray LA won't take you back
I'm supposed to spearhead this Christian rap record
And not the musings of a winded fact-checker
So I feel about an inch tall
And I got pre-teens to enthrall
So I pimp all the cost shares, install the software
But still I feel like my back is against the wall

Cuz you can ward off U.S. wars
By fingering warped fret boards
See we exploit our talents so we can raise kids
Like my homie Trey, he's the poor women's Taye Diggs
But when it comes to love I stain the bedding
Catching bouquets at the wedding
But this don't go hand and hand with your Volkswagon van
Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man


(get up)The Troglodyte wins (get down)
Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man
(get up)The Troglodyte wins (get down)
Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man

Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man
(get up)The Troglodyte wins (get down)
Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man

I'm always tellin them that.

We don't believe in you[Ass to mouth, ass to mouth (x3)
When I drop shit I'm all that you ask about] x2

Made a big splash on the gossip column
When I hit the rock bottom
In the street, spending electric bills
I'm dumb enough to try to reinvent the wheel

And it's volunteered
Just for the names on the blogosphere (?)
I'm finna give what you want to hear
Ohhhh, YEAH

My outbursts set the bar high
Wildfires set with our supplies
Rotisserie'd and MRI'd
They keep taking shots like bar flies

And I return fire!
I return fire
I return fire
Aroused in the midst of a church choir

All the freaks in the seats need to get engaged (?)
So the intelligentsia acts barely drinking age

It sound like

[Ass to mouth, ass to mouth (x3)
When I drop shit I'm all that you ask about] x2

If you think I've eaten my fill, well you've heard wrong
My stomach's only filled with birdsong
My body's waste is like precious metal
So I walk around thinking I'm extra special

But i'm the Antichrist!
I'm the Antichrist
I'm the Antichrist
So what I say, it can't be blessed

They eat shit sandwiches at the discotheque
And they talk about me to keep their whistles wetWe do not have the lyrics for Swandive Into A Drinking Glass yet.We do not have the lyrics for Great Spooks of Enormous Strength yet.By chance are you free
Here's my room key and splayed limbs
When I do me I play to win - Yeah (...)
You'll need to go drink absinthe
Under trees that grow leaves of absence (I left your ass alone)
While nursing hearts like leaking gaskets
This freedom it tastes funny
Dealing with utilitarian uses of love
To the ladies I'll be vague
Because I'm streching my sea legs
Dipping my toe in the sleaziest cesspools above
My stage persona can be nude
Because the following day, it's renewed
And my subconscious is seafood - Yeah
When you invite me, I cross over
You'll smell burning and a waft sulfur
You've crashed along the soft shoulder
Yeah - This freedom it tastes funny
Dealing with utilitarian uses of love
To the ladies I'll be vague
Because I'm streching my sea legs
Dipping my toe in the sleaziest cesspools above
Value sets and other moral imperatives
And frankly we don't give a fuck about them
- Yes, you do - No, I don't
- You do - No, I don't
We don't give a fuck about them (3x)
The sex drive stupefies
Makes you feel like you're in Junior High
My impulses go unsupervised - Yeah
I prow on foot and spin a yarn
When the crowd looks like wind farms
My defense mechanism's been disarmed
Yeah - This freedom it tastes funny
Dealing with utilitarian uses of loveI know this group and they're so avantcore
I bought their shit at the mom and pop store
And I give all of their songs the top score
I'll see them play on their small hip-hop tour
They're treated like sex symbols, out the stretch-limos
Autographing breasts with lead pencils
Now everybody thinks that they're the best new group
As if they're a pop band test tube fluke
They bought a home that's the size of a ballpark
You can only cross the property with a golf cart
But they no longer can sell a billion records
Because when they first weren't trying was their last brilliant effort

Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like "I heard you sold this many units" and I say "wish me better luck next year"

There seems to be too much water pressure underneath your genre-mesh blur
And to be honest I never took interest in the modern day Young Black Teenagers
I'd thought they'd gone away replacing what's on gun racks with cheese graters
To use on the spongy mind of the LA rapper swinging from a monkey vine
Style biting used to result in a money fine, but now

Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like I'm edgy and I'm risqué and I say better luck next year

I replied to the wuss with a yo' mama's joke
When he said how much he pushed the envelope
A group of sexually ambivalent nihilists
Crying from an ovarian cyst
Picking at a vegetarian dish
Idolizing a German band who barely exists
But me, my name's never on the full-color flyer
I'm just the dull Busdriver
Thinking 'til my head is a bowl of dust fibers
To all the fools up under their trucker hats
Sagging until you can see their plumber's cracks
There is no metaphorical meaning
So don't bother sifting through the storyboard in one seating
It's just horribly demeaning
And you can't do burners
I want the colors back
Don't want to hear your dumb ideas
Just shut your trap
Jumping jacks thunder claps in your bubble gum raps

Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like "I did a song with so-and-so and I got signed" but the checks will never clearThis year I thought I'd do away with celebrity-endorsed barbarism
And to keep the people guessing get a bio-diesel engine
to cut my carbon emissions
Further my career by trading favors with aged ravers
You know, use the barter system
But I sat on my black ass sucking on sassafras
In my apartment bitching
Last year you were posing on the hood of a Lamborghini
In Gucci glasses and a tan bikini
Dating Meg White, eating tiramisu
I was rapping at a test site, banned from TV
And in therapy too
For pulling firearms out of Jell-O molds
With a sinister grin the color mellow gold
Running from the Southland PD

Pompous posies your party's no fun
Yeah whooptie-do
You can't offset the OG's cardio-sponge
Yeah whooptie-do
Though you've made millions off us
Yeah whooptie-do
This year we're getting off our butts
Yeah whooptie-do
Mutherfucker
Yeah whooptie-do
…

This year I thought I'd cover you
with a thicket of wet unwarranted smooches
Rather than entertain sore feelings at board meetings
with these corporate mooches
Or being run over by un-sober law enforcement douches
It's sensible that I'm a randy-romper,
a panty-dropper with these whorish pooches
Last year I was passing out Green Party leaflets
When you're at the chalet on ski-trips
Getting neo-cons all peeved and miffed
Heaving and choking on beef-bits
Cuz I ain't appeasing shit
Wearing tutus and a Bluetooth in a Subaru
Yeah you too
Can get your knees split, bitch

Pompous posies your party's no fun
Yeah whooptie-do
You can't offset the OG's cardio-sponge
Yeah whooptie-do
Though you've made millions off us
Yeah whooptie-do
This year we're getting off our butts
Yeah whooptie-do
Mutherfucker
Yeah whooptie-do

Last year they made buoys out of bloated bodies in the Big Easy
And nobody liked what the
Blowed embodied yet they bit freely
Rappers used recording booths
like porti-potties being inexplicably cheesy
And I'm an out of work hobo
at the Mojave with a dripping squeegee
This year I'm going to make only one friend
This squatter girl at the opium den
Checking her viral load, wearing a bridal robe
Fresh off her codeine-drug bend
Cuz f@#$ them pop divas
They need pitch shifters and Brita pitchers
full of mixed liquor, I'm a clit piercer
Of that bitch nigga that manages you

Pompous posies your party's no fun
Yeah whooptie-do
You can't offset the OG's cardio-sponge
Yeah whooptie-do
Though you've made millions off us
Yeah whooptie-do
This year we're getting off our butts
Yeah whooptie-do
Mutherfucker
Yeah whooptie-doBusdriver: 
Uh oh

Nocando: 
'ey I don't need no popper stoppers, 
cause the money in the pop. 
Nocando, Busdriver.

Busdriver: 
Wait hold on though

Nocando: 
Project blowed

Busdriver: 
Don't say my name though

Nocando: 
Poppin P's profusely

Busdriver: 
I don't want people to know I'm on this song

Nocando: 
These sneaker geek emcees to me is so Broke Back
So fuck sexy in '09 I'm bringing broke back

Busdriver:
Your favorite rapper's brawny
Wearing a French braided hair shirt
My bank account been scrawny
Since I was a 10th grader square twerp

Nocando:
Your favorite rapper is extravagant
Aside from his pompous name
He's like a nursery with more cribs than John McCain

Busdriver:
Your favorite dude champions every Chicago city slum
From his condominium
While brandishing his implausible mini-gun

Nocando:
He sells more drugs than the FDA
He's ready for war like FDR
I believe him whole-heartedly
Because he keeps saying it in every bar

Busdriver:
Your favorite guy said he shot niggas
On the grass lawn in his rap song
But he's sweeter than baked goods
When he claims his hood as Capcom

Nocando: 
Your favorite rapper's got Alzheimer's
Repeats himself like a old timer
He works harder than a gold miner
When it comes to picking ghostwriters

Busdriver:
And me, I'm your least favorite
With a haircut like a pineapple
Wearing khakis torn singing hi-soprano
Loading candy corns like it's live ammo

Nocando:
What's wrong with you?

Busdriver:
Oh, Oh! I'm your least favorite rapper
My records only get released in Anchorage, Alaska

Nocando:
What's wrong with you?

Busdriver: 
Oh, Oh! I'm your least favorite rapper
Rummaging through debris of screenplays and actors

Nocando:
What the fuck is wrong with you?

Busdriver: 
Oh, Oh! I can't lease space ships from NASA
Because I'm the least favorite rapper

Nocando:
What's wrong with you?

Busdriver:
I am your least favorite
I am your least favorite
I am your least favorite

Nocando: 
I am your least favorite rapper
my release date is after
the D-Day disaster
I need to get cheesecake for master

Busdriver:
I am your least favorite Flavor Flav impersonator
Pissing on the circuit breaker

Nocando:
While the strippers do the percolator

Busdriver:
I will be spell-checking some blurb in the paper

Nocando:
Read by the type of hipster
That don't like me yellin all kinds of niggas
While I'm vibing with you like Michael Richards
Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga, Nigga

Busdriver:
Still unliked because my leading single's about
Laser beams and force fields
And my hoopty's not full of groupies
Just Mabellyne and orange peels
But I'll serve niggas at the Pizza hut

Nocando:
And the suburban kids say I'm not street enough
But compared to them I'm street as fuck

Busdriver:
I will put USB ends in their tween cunts

Nocando:
When it comes to this nerd rap
It seems like the black thing's a problem
You know what I Idi A-mean
I feel like the last king of Scotland

Busdriver:
So my job has me cultivating all the white guilt
Dipping Polaroids in rice milk
Smacking Souja Boy wearing corduroys
And an iced grill

Nocando:
The new rap fans listen to 'Ye
Start sniffing the yay pretending they're gay
Put a switch in their hips and a feminine sway
Just to convince the women to stay

Busdriver:
And sell out like it was Christmas Day
And give everyone an admission to pay
For a tit in the face

Nocando:
I was beginning to say
What came first the chicken or egg
The twist in the fray, dissident fan that listens today
Dissipates visits and strays
What the fuck
Did our whole approach to business decay

Busdriver:
We underused all the parlor tricks
Instead of talking about art and shit
I should have put my hardened dick
In the hind quarters of Time Warner

Nocando: 
It's over! 
That fool just served Time Warner, 
fools are sniffin' yay, 
that fool had tits at your Christmas party!
Shout out to Forest Whitaker, Idi Amin!
Yeah!

Nocando:
What's wrong with you?

Busdriver:

Rummaging through debris of screenplays and actors

Because I'm your least favorite rapper

Everything

Hi, I'm Regan
I don't rap for free
And yes I've got a bachelors degree but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become

This year my pigment's bluer
What am I, a crip from hoover?
Oh no, It's a malignant tumour!
Oh, I knew it. Come on!
And still you never would admit how sick I've become

This is "Perfect Hair" by Busdriver
It costs .146 million US dollars to make
The musical accompaniment on tracks 5 through 12 cost 6000 euros each
The backup singers used on tracks 1 through 3 cost 3500 US dollars per take
The studio time at our home studios cost half a million Brazilian reals per lockout session

I'm a frequent flyer
And a decent liar
And that's a lie in itself but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become

I eat my food raw
Grew up bourgeois
Never run game like a cue ball
But you knew that, come on
And so you'll never admit how sick I've become

I'm not a cool dad
Nor a new fad
I'm my daughter's own private enigma, come on
And still she never could admit how sick I've become

I'm dope as fuck
I know what's up
And I did not blow up but you knew that, come on
And so you never would admit how sick I always was

My clothes are dirty
And I'm over thirty
And you can't quit me cold turkey but you knew that, come on
It's about time we've admitted how sick this has become

I'm no one
And everywhere I only breathe heavy air
But you knew that, come on
Why can't we admit how sick this has become?

I used to wake up at noon
To punch the moon
And fuck my life in her puncture wound
Come on

Come onWe do not have the lyrics for Scattered Ashes yet.
