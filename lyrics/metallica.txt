Lay beside me and tell me what they've done
And speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralize
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still but there's no sun shining through
No there's no sun shining through, no there's no sun shining

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still but she'll never love again
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black hearts scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes she'll be there when I'm gone, dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you

Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
So I dub thee unforgiven

Oh, what I've felt
Oh, what I've known
I'll take this key and I'll bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free, never me
Because you're unforgiven tooSay your prayers little one
Don't forget my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
'Til the sandman, he comes, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Grippin' your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never, never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Grippin' your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never, never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep

If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never, never land

We're off to never, never land
  (Take my hand)
We're off to never, never land
  (Take my hand)
We're off to never, never landBorn to push you around
You better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouths so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying, just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hiding yourself, crawling yourself
You'll have your time

God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this grave

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put it into this I swear
This I swear the sun will shine
This I swear, this I swear
This I swear!How could he know
This new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

Set sail to sea
But pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid
Always afraid
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost,
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on
Inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating

His sinking life
Outside it's hell
Inside, intoxication

He's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow

Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me
Why can't I forgive me?

(Solo)

Set sail to sea
But pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

How could he know
This new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

How can I be lost,
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left to me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much to real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I lived

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a war time novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this shit off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God, wake me
Please God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please God, help me, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body, my holding cell

Land mine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul
Leaving me with a life in Hell

Oh, please God, help me
Help meHey, I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who cares

They, they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They, they'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

You, you're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You, you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed

Do, do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do, do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
l I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Hate, I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay, pay the price
Pay, for nothing's fair

Hey, I'm your life
I'm the one who took you here
Hey, I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside open your eyes
I'm you

Sad but trueMama, they try and break me

The window burns
To light the way back home
A light that warms
No matter where they've gone now

They're off to find
The hero of the day
Oh, but what if they should fall
By someone's wicked way

Still the window burns, time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighin'
Keepers of the flames, do you feel your names?
Can't you hear your baby's crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

S'cuse me
While I tend to how I feel
These things return to me
That still seem real

Now deservingly
This easy chair
But the rocking stopped
By wheels of despair, yeah

Don't want your aid but the fist I've made
For years, won't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me, so please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your baby's crying now?

Still the window burns, time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighin'
Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your baby's crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That everlast the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't hear your baby's crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they try

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they trySo close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Yeah, trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, that's right

Never opened myself this way
And life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters, yeah

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
I never cared for what they do
I never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah yeah yeahMake his fight on the hills in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun on they run through the endless gray
On they fight for their right, yes, but who's to say?

For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Suffered wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain and they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It is the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry

Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsWelcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged

Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Can I breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane

They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on, natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air, got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out againOn a lonely lonesom highway*
East of Omaha
You can listen to the engine moanin'
Out his one long song
You can think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

And your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours
And there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like ridin'
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
Here I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaraunt
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode
Yeah, Most times you can't here 'em talk
Other times you can

Yeah the same 'ole cliches...
Is it woman, is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand

Here I am, on the road again
Here I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

Out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play

Later in the evening
As you lie awake in bed
The echos of the amplifiers
Ringin' in your head
You smoke the days last cigarette
Remembering what she said
What she said

Here I am, on the road again
Here I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
There I go, turn the page
There I go, yeah yeah
There I go, Yeah yeah

There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
Here I go-oah
Here I go...

And gone.Say your prayers little one
Don't forget my son
To include everyone

I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
'Til the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light, enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light, enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)

If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord, my soul to take
(Pray the Lord, my soul to take)

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light, enter night

We're off to never, never land
We're off to never, never landSpineless from the start
Sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
You play the lead clown

Please, please
Spreading his disease
Living by his story

Knees, knees
Falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet

Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks
Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
Rotting your brain

Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Stinking by his glamor

Fame, fame
Infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power, we see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet

Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet

Make a contribution
And you'll get a better seat

Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lieEnd of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, it's sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, I'll hear you scream
Master, master

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me, you will see
More, that's all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm fucking you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, I'll hear you scream
Master, master, master

Master, master
Where's those dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies

Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries, fix me, baby

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams, baby
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name, I'll hear you scream
Master, masterFortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd
Cry the nowhere tears of honor

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light
Of an already faded prima Donna

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun
Sets behind your back

Can't the band play on
Just listen they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane

Dance little tin goddess

The memories remain
Yeah, to this faded prima Donna
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Little tin goddess, dance

Say yes, at least say hello
Say yes, at least say helloKeep it going [Incomprehensible]
Yeah

My life suffocates
Planting the seeds of hate
Our love, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate

I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

[Incomprehensible]

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
  (Harvester of sorrow)

C'mon man, get it, hey

Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow

Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies

Uh, yeah, uh, uh, yeahWhere do I take this pain of mine
I run, but it stays right my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me, until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it all once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open, but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me

No longer will you hurt anyone
And the face still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me, oh, yeah
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you

Until it sleeps

So tear me open, but beware
The things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me, till I'm clean

I'll tear me open, a big jar
No longer would you hurt anyone
And the fear still shapes me
So hold me, until it sleeps

Until it sleeps
Until it sleeps

Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

We shift, pulsing with the earth
Company we keep, roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill is the air, cold as steel tonight
We shift, call of the wild
Fear in your eyes, it's later than you realized

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

I feel a change
Back to a better day, shape shift
Hair stands on the back of my neck, shape shift
Wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of wolf and manNo more the crap rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much, you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Didn't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance, go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Ya, who the hell are you?
Ya, ha you

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not, notReaching out for somethin' you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

What the hell? What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite, hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within

Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Reaching out, reaching out
Grabbing for somethin' you've got to feel
Closing in, closing in
Pressure upon you is so unreal

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, struggling within

Struggle
Don't

Reaching out for somethin' you got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

What the hell
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruin
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, struggling within(instrumental)Die, die, die my darling, don't utter a single word
