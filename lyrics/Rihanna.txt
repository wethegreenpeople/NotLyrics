Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck

Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame
To be what you is, you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar, hey baby
I'm a rockstar, hey baby
Big city, bright lights
Sleep all day, up all night

Six inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good, check my panties and my bra

Wildin' out a crazy house with my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?
To be what you is, you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rockstar, hey baby

Feels so good being bad
There’s no way I’m turning back
Now the pain is for pleasure, ’cause nothing can measure
Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more.

[Chorus:]
‘Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me.

Na-na-na come on, come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na) come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it.

[J. Cole:]
Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn this up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped
Do you like rough sex, hit em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet
Let, let, lets go, you rocking with Cole, it’s the best flow
With the game on lock while them lamo’s watch
I’m on fire, they are not
I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you got bad, you only got badder

[Chorus:]
‘Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me.

Na-na-na come on, come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na) come on
Come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on

Give my body some AHH, AHH, AHHHH,
I like it, like it

[Repeat Chorus (2x):]

Na-na-na come on, come on

Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

[Chorus:]
In this California king Bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars for your heart for me
My California King

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (next to me)
Arm to arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last nite on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us

[Chorus:]
In this California king Bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars for your heart for me
My California King

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been california dreaming

[Chorus:]
In this California king Bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars for your heart for me
My California King

In this California king Bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars for your heart for me
My California KingFeel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction, such an eruption
Sound is my remedy, feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care, I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(Feel it in the air, yeah)

She's a mean and crazy dicta, disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her, too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dance floor
Better not to take me home, base kicking so hot
Blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, party's getting hardcore

Heard everybody is getting low a little sexy
On the crazy juice, this will end up on the news

Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care, I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(Feel it in the air, yeah)

She's a mean and crazy dicta, disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her, too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Ultrasexual, the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Oh, oh, uh oh

Ultrasexual, the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum, beating like a disco drum

Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her, too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?As I was walkin' down the road
To Bethlehem one night
I looked up to the sky
And there I saw a wondrous sight

A star was shining brighter
Than I'd ever seen before
And a host of angels sang to me
Never heard a song so pure

They said don't be afraid
We bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy
For every boy and every girl

A Child is born
On this holy night
And all the Angels sing of the joy
He brings with a star so bright

So come to see
Mary's sweet Baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn King
While He sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully, oh, yeah

As I went down into the town
To see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings
Came ridin' up to me

They said they seek the Child
Who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be
The mightiest by far

So wake up everybody
'Cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell
The news to everyone

A Child is born
On this holy night
And all the Angels sing of the joy
He brings with a star so bright

So come to see
Mary's sweet Baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn King
While He sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully

Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

So wake up everybody

And ring the bell so we can

And let our praises ring to the newborn King
While He sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully

Story Of My Life
Searching For The Right
But It Keeps Avoiding Me
Sorrow In My Soul
Cause It Seems That Wrong
Really Loves My Company

He's More Than A Man
And This Is More Than Love
The Reason That The Sky Is Blue
But Clouds Are Rolling In
Because I'm Gone Again
And To Him I Just Can't Be True

And I Know That He Knows I'm Unfaithful
And It Kills Him Inside
To Know That I Am Happy With Some Other Guy
I Can See Him Dying

I Don't Wanna Do This Anymore
I Don't Wanna Be The Reason Why
Everytime I Walk Out The Door
I See Him Die A Little More Inside
I Don't Wanna Hurt Him Anymore
I Don't Wanna Take Away His Life
I Don't Wanna Be...

So Many Nights On The Road Im Alone,
Seenin' Me Dialing Your Phone,
Wondering Why Your Not Home,
Finding Out Your Not Alone,
Im Hearing Romours From All These Familiar Faces,
They Tellin Me Your Cheating,
Revealing Your Secret Places,
Showing Me Locations Of All Your Private Vacations,
And Showing Me The Phone Bill Of All Your Convosations,
I Pay For That Cell Phone,
I Sign For Your Car Loan,
I Pay For Your Wardrobe,
And Purchased Your All Home,
I Gave You Ma Whole Life ,
I Turned You To My Wife,
No Money And No Price,
Can Match What I Sacrafice..

No calling, saying you want me back,

We would still Have Us

Got a wardrobe like she's staring in a movie
And she ain't even famous but she got her own groupies

You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl

[Rihanna:]
No use, Your lips keep moving
But I got a couple screws loose
Them other boys talkin' bout me
They say I'm that miss, and
Probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interupt, It's time to start me up

[Bridge:]
I don't think you wanna do that right now
And not with me, Don't start with me I got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
I gotta feeling, I'll burn it down, I'll burn you downnn

All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body, Let these ladies know
Don't bring this hoe around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get fired up
Wanna see me get wild

[Chorus:]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hear what I said
I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't hear what I said
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

In the parking lot, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, Don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run But you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you,
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it but I let my screws loose
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Really take a lot to work me up

[Bridge:]
I don't think you wanna do that right now
And not with me, Don't start with me I got a attitude on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
I gotta feeling, I'll burn it down, I'll burn you downnn

Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wind
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right baby
So push my buttons
You see me get wild
Uh go wild baby

[Chorus:]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Did you hear what I said
I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny
Like you ain't heard what I said
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head

Uh ohh uh ohh
Sometimes I go crazy
Uh ohh uh ohh
Watch me Watch me
Uh ohh uh ohh
Sometimes I go crazy

[Justin Timberlake:]
Break it down
I hear voices in my head
They go oo ohh ooooo

[Rihanna:]
I got a hole in my head

Sometimes I get crazy and
I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny
Did you hear what I said

Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Ay ay ay I gotta hole in my head
Don't look at me funny

[Justine Timberlake:]
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head

You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl[Verse 1:]
I rest my hand across your lips*
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I delay what is right
But this love it wont give up without a fight

Id write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear its gonna hurt me even more

[Chorus:]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2:]
Wish I could see your dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me its better just like this

So this is how the story ends
When love is gone you cant pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you

[Chorus:]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge:]
You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You mustve known this day will come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no

[Chorus:]
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly

You gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye
You gonna have to teach me how to say
GoodbyeI'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man
'Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had, I just think it's so sad

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down

They keep evil thoughts in their hearts
What you don't know
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle

They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down

Don't be fooled you betta recognize
They not there for you, they don't care for you
Trust me 'cuz I know it's true

Ya know they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So, hold on to your sanity

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down

If you never ask
How can I drive you crazy
When I've got no gas
How could we be together
When we're so far apart
You tell me that you love me then you go and break my heart

I'll admit that I've got problems if
You say that you will help me solve 'em yes
I realize some days I can be sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour

Just because
I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Only when, you go away and I can get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour

Why should I be your woman
When you've got 2 more
Why should I say that I do
When I know you don't
Why should I stay here with you
When you are always gone
And why should I be open when you stay so bottled up

I'll admit that I've got problems if
You say that you will help me solve 'em yes
I realize some days I can be sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Just because
I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Only when, you go away and I can get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour

You were are all I ever needed
You were all I ever had
You were all I ever wanted
But you were making me bad

"I need a drink"
"Can I have a part-time lover"
"Shakin', not stirred"
"On the rocks"

Just because
I'm never happy when I'm sobered up
I'm only good if I can have a cup
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hour
Only when, you go away and I can get my fix
I'm only good if I can have a sip
Some days I'm sweet and some I'm sour
But I can't help but drink you up, cause you're my happy hourGotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark

I met him on the 6 train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lot a game
And he open from the start

He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine
And I'm so glad that he's all mine

There's a thug in my life
How'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me

There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna 'cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need

I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality
A side they never see

My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart don't lock down
I feel loved and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me

There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna 'cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me, he's all I ever need

We'll be together from now till forever
I know it's the real thing, if you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be

There's a thug in my life
How'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me

There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna 'cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me

We'll be together*Bonus Track*

Feels so good being bad (Oh oh oh oh oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure cause nothing could measure (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Outta box, outta line (Oh oh oh oh oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

And meet me in my boudoir with my body suit on-on-on

I like it-like it

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red doors get a block back to the presidents
I used to run my old block like Obama did
You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then

Couldn't even come in my room
Smell like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California
Tell them to give me back my swag
They try to clone me

You see my Louis chucks, Louis bag, Louis frames,
Louis belt
What that make me
Louis Mane

With my new black watch called the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac wrist

Hard!

One word describes me
And if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard

Rose petals
Heart break
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes
Tuxedo
Fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

I ask you
What's the matter
You say
Oh, it's nothing at all
Heart's racing
Outta control
And you knew
That I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive
Injured us fatally
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I pray that love don't strike twice

Red lip stick
Rose petals
Heart break
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes
Tuxedo
Fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy (Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy
What's love without tragedy

Mother Mary
I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus
I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people
Would even know my name
As time flies
Way above me
For you
I've cried, tears sea-deep
Oh glory
The prayers carry me

I'll be a star, you keep directing me

Let's capture the moment
Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promised, forever
