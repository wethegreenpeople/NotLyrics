Oh yea, I'm quite a dictive, it's madatary 4 me to spit this
Mac Dre that big ol playa
So much game I need to run 4 Mayor, or even President
Just livin large, Ooo they wood hate 2 see a brotha in Charge
Drivin round town with the system Jammin
They woodn't understand to hear the president slammin
With the dead presidents or I'm stackin yah
I gotta make me another flip a maximum
Celluar phones, hot bedroom homes, and a 14th carco Microphone
I like to send a romp shot to my homeboy D
Put the R to the O to the M to the P
Just a little somethin to make u bug
Get romped out and put a hole in the rug
Wheather in a car or at a party
Don't be scared to dance like marty
Put a double romp boggie in your behind
Pay close attention while I spit this rhyme
I don't drive a caddy, cause I'm not betty
I like to drive round town in a tite ass chevy
With 2inch white walls, yea that's rite ya'll
Call me on my beeper, leave a code I mite call
And if not I'll see you in the traffic
On my way to make my money and stack it
It's the same everyday, everday is the same

But I ain't trippin, I keep on Mackin, keep on pimpin, I keep on stackin
Them green dollars that u no I no I do
Makin these fonky ass songs for you
I went to Claim Bay, for a little of practice
Now that I'm back UH! I'm at this
Police still jack, I just laugh
They say wheres the dope, I say u want a autograph
I use a ink pen to sell my drug
I'm gonna keep on writin 4 the bitches and thugs
With a white, black, or u can slap um
Give me a drug beat, and we'll be partyin
I'm just like that, I ain't trippin
And if the bitch is fine, then I'm spitin
Cause in the party I'm a horny muthaphucka
Gurls in tite jeans don't press your luck bout
Step to like a pimp, then shot u to the telly then do yah
Yea u no the Mac is real retarded
Bout is fonk as a fat man farted
I don't slow down, I just speed up
A yo Mac Dre fire the weed up
Cause I really flow, when my eyes get low
Or I'm really really jucied at a Mac Dre song
Wat ever the equation my eyes are red
Fat 40 in the hand, and beleive I said that
Been an alcohlic since the age of 13
Believe my brotha I'm a dope fein
I need Ol E, that's my pipe
My mouth is a flame, I heat up the mic
And in a battle, I'm sure as corshin
And if your really talkin shit then I'l str8 up tourch ya
He flows down, hah, I'm 4rm the V town
I'm bout to heat up, turn the beat up
Now I'm short ya'll and I like to thank ya'll

And blow the smoke out at the same time
So I can get a tic, while I'm spitin my rhyme

Just a hutlin' muthafucka (What else), thata' bust yo' shit (else).Yeah man, young Mac Dre
I pops it boy, I pops it big

It all started off with the doctor telling my momma push
On that night in 1-9-7-0 mac dre hopped outhtat puss
I've been soaking game since rock 'em sock 'em and hot wheels
Not never the chance to pass me I keep 'em jocking, I got skills
And when I'm on the mic, styles I got so many
Drink privilege hennessy when I ain't fuckin' with brehmi
M-A-C-D-R-E, that's me
Like 'em freaky like Janet not Jackson but Jackme, whee
To all my niggas in Atlanta to Alabama
Rodreego blowin' only homie, don't fuck with bama
I planned to have a ticket and kick it in the bahamas
Watch your hutch and don't trust your baby momma
Cause I will get your scrill when I kill all in them guts
Don't give a fuck when you give a crippled crab a crutch
But they respect it if not they get rejected
I'm M-D the MC that's not to be corrected

[? ], uno, dos, cuatro
I'm sicker than ten j-cats that be gone off that vato
Most sexual intelectuall with at least 6 figures before the decimal
Warm, hot, and respectable but I'm nothing correctable

I fucks with high rollers, shake highway patrollers
Quick to pop the trunk but will come from the shoulders
Got a cuddie named Dubee, he spit more raps than loogies
And when he hand it to me I'm funky like him to me
Baby do me is all them hutches holler
I was breakin' bitches when phantom tops was on granada
More game than keno, down to trips to reno
Sippin' cappachino with Natalia Shapino
C-note stacka' pack a P-89
Love group sex take 'em three at a time
And boy I be out of line when I'm full that tangerey
Quick to grab the chopper, cock, aim and spray
Urban guerilla warfare extraordinare
You know a bout my maccing but boy I'm more than a player
Resurrected double R elected
Haters get ejected I'm nothing to be corrected


Pistol packin' player, gangsta mac for real
About my scrill got to pay my bills
Boy I'm in it to win it if you weak and timid
Better watch how you spend I take yalls like timmy
Busting out like tities in a bra that's too small
Grew up off too short stackin' scrill too tall
Max Drizzay, all damn dizzay
I keep hoes dizzay in a one time busay(busy)
Been rappin' before they called mac mall Brehmis
Rompin' peace Mike Robinson son of Dennis
I'm in this to deep like Tim, Jim, and Johnny
Much love for my cuddies Jay, Ray, and Ronny
Raping pockets I get mine however it come
Boy I get dumb about my income
Mac furly up early sippin' X-O
Nothing correctable; nigga you knowAyy, Whats goin on, It's your partner back in here
One more time
Servin it, cuz you deservin it
Ya know I've been gone for a long time
Put it down somethin special

The game I spit is fat like Oprah
Got more soul than deep fried Oklah
Dope like China White
Not like dynamite
Blowin up the spot cuz dude, I'm kinda tight
Raps flow fat like beer from cake taps
Slap them saps and give dabs to big mac
Seasoned veteran this game I'm indulgin
Pockets bulgin from bankin trojans
Love my grip but don't trip off ghetto freaks
Kill for skrill but chill deep in them ghetto streets
Dodge and duck when police chase me
Sharp as Fuuuck, cuz OGs lately
Me and my mic is like gin and soko
Dunk and yako
Foot in sock oooh, you didn't know
Well peep this mane
And recognize Mac Dre is the name
I step to the mic with intent to lace those
Who lack the nack to mac stack and break hoes
I come raw
But keep it oh so real
I got the kind of game to make a female kill
And I go deep up in some chassey
Doggy style like that mutt called lassey
They all chase me, like cat chase mice
And I play them, like fools play dice
I'm what is known as the play B-O-Y
Some people trip cuz Dre be so fly

I stay dipped like them fools from G-Qs
Step into the party and they all say he's cool

My lyrical content is deep like a good book
I serve flavor, just like a good cook
Grab a mic and ill at a party
Rap so good I send chills through your body
Rhyme style
Tight like coochie, rolled like sushi, funky like voot said
And top notch is what they rate Dre
Cuz I got more rhymes than food at Safeway
So make waaay
For the M-A-C
As I put the Crest Side on the M-A-P
I got more game than that fool cat, say Jack
I'm a G, a player from waay back
Skill superior, far from inferior
Got the pimp shell with the gangsta interior
And with the broads I'm smooth as suave son
And when it's funk I get the job done
So don't underestimate the great Mac
Cuz I make raps, and pimp to make laps
I hate saps
Can't stand a smurf, definition of smurf
Sucka mark in a church
I purr
Off cavasi yak
Slightly heated with a gram on yeah
Never hesitate to put game in a tight rap
Mac Dre is the name, and I like that[Intro: Mac Dre]
Yeah
I feel ya
I don't know what to say
That's how it's going down?

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Woke up one mornin 'bout 6 o'clock
Dick still smellin' like spit n cock
Beeper vibratin' like a nympho sex toy
It's time to collect, them hoes got they checks boy
But on my way out the motel room the bitch said
'Dre, why must you go so soon'?
Thinkin' about the night before and how she licked me
I bounced back in so I could get me a quicky
Dick hard as ten pounds of frozen neckbones
I got my wreck on and got the heck on
Droppin' a ho off, you know I had to show off
I burnt rubber and the bitch tried to go off
But all I did was laugh, like she was a joke
Hit the gas, and left her ass in smoke
Strikin' in my Chevrolet you know I had to smash it
Dippin' and dodgin', makin' my way through traffic
Marily marily, marily marily I go
Looked in the rearview, damn
It's 5-0
Once again pullin' me over for the jack up
In my mirror I can see him callin' back up
But I ain't goin' out like no sucka
Put the pedal to the metal and smoked the mothafucka
Stopped at the store on Sacramento and Tennessee
Got a pack of zig-zags and a fifth of hennessy
Percin' off the dank and the drank connection
It's back to my mission nigga, bank collection

Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Rollin' in my old school Lincoln, drinkin'
Joint between my lips and I'm dankin', sinkin'
Deep in the seat, with the beat on the down-low
But I ain't trippin' on the way it really sound though
I got down ho, ready to hit the track
And bring back fat stack of them greenbacks
Hit the stroll but before I let her go
I let her know, she's nothing but my ho
4 was the time on my wristwatch
Grabbed my phone, turned it on, cause I just got a motherfuckin
Beep from a freak on another strip
Get the hennessy and I take me another sip
Call the bitch back and she's ready, to kick down
What she made, from just gettin' dick down
Bounce to the spot where my ho does work
See her in a skirt and a see-through shirt
Pull her off the track and I don't say shit
Cause all I wanna hear is that purse unzip
Lookin' at the bitch with the pimpish grin
Feelin like the mac as my ho kicks in
Let the bitch out, start unloadin' my cut
Let the 15's slam and I'm fuckin em up
They can't understand how I bounce my head
Smokin' on a joint at a light that's red
Niggas can't be me but they wish they could
The light turned green and I hit the hood
See my homeboy Don in a '74
The rollers got him jacked but they lettin' him go
Catch up with him up at the light
Said 'what's up cuddie, where they at tonight'?
He said 'it's goin on playa at the afterdark
And there's a house party bumpin in college park'
Playa waved to my homie then I split from the scene
It's back to my mission nigga, gettin' the green

Back to my mission
Back to my mission

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Late one night, I drove my Brome to the burger spot
Stepped in all I saw was a herd of cock
Went in my pocket, came out with the yack bottle
Twist the cap then I took me a fat swallow
All I could smell was cock in the air
And I can tell by they stare they was jockin' the playa
Went to the counter ordered burger and milkshake
The girl standin' behind me was thick with silk fake
Hair that looked the real but she had looks to kill
I Stepped back and gave the broad my spill
Told her my name and she couldn't believe dat
Kept spittin' game til I peelt her weave back
She recognized the playa and she knew I was major
Gave her the number to my Pactel pager
Snatched my grub, then I hopped in my town car
And let them landstars slam, and pound hard
Honked at the hutch when I cut from the scene
Then it's back to my mission nigga
Gettin' the green

Back to my mission
Back to my mission[verse 1]
When we pull up to the light the people all stare
four niggas in the benz with the dredlock hair

Burnin rubber in the shitnell, with the 4-0-2
Dippin, dashin, smashin
Through the traffic
Smokin, chokin, hopin,
I rap it
'Cause my candy's look wet, three coats of clear
Miami's on deck with three quartes of beer
Clownin all the freaks but he still gets jocked
Bouncin in the seat while the 15's knock
I'm dipped in butter everybody jocks my style
Cal hat pulled down to my eyebrow
Polo geared down
I'm in her ear now
Stealin it, she's feelin it, it's all clear now
One more hoe, on my team
I'm a pimp homeboy, what do you mean
It's all about scrilla in the land of thugs and killers
Gangstas, pimps, players, and drug dealers

If you, wanna fuck with me
Be about yo doe, I gots to get my doe
I'm just trying to let you know

It's 2 in the morning and I'm still chasin cash
Other niggaz in the club, still chasin ass
Fuck theezat
I'm all about my screezatch
I got my fishing pole out trying to ceezatch
A big fish, I'm hungary, need a big bitch
I'm a bump a bitch with the quickness
Boy it's just pimpin in my blood
Bitches, they all give him love
The Mac name Dre bitch, take it easy
You fuckin with a street nigga that's greasy
I'll buck yo brotha, fuck yo motha
Keep it on the DL, it's all undercover
I'm a hustler bitch, I pull capers
I only fuck with thugs that get paper
Chips, chedda, scrilla, real niggaz, killaz, and drug dealers

24 hours, 7 days a week
I do my thug thang, playin in them streets
But the game I play really ain't no joke
Come around my way and you might get smoked
Bullet proof vest's, Chevy SS's
Come through in a bucket
The next day in a Lexus
It's a ghetto life
I don't have no wife
Boy I'm married to the game and I handle my
Business, I'm in this for the money not the honey
Square bitches spooked, they all run from me
Dummy, bitch, if you knew better, you do better
I'm a stay on bitch back like new sweaters
Mac Dre baby
Quit talkin crazy
When you get about some money
It's all gravy
Ask my last bitch square, that's all realla
I only fuck with pimps, killaz and drug dealers[Chorus:]
Here's a little something about me da mac
I like the low cut jeans where you can see the crack
Get drunk off the priv, the heem, the yak
Then drink a double shot to bring me back
Im from where you never see a seed in the sack
The bay boy and dre boy is bringin it back
Im hella suffa, whats the meanin of that?
You'll neva see a nigga thats as clean as the mac

[Verse 1:]
Call me mr Kleenex, I'm so cold
Icy wrists like I've been making snow cones
Wassup homes, what size them rims is?
TWENTY TWO, muthafuckin inches
Seats big as benches, I neva touch wrenches
The only work I do is working these bitches
My palm itches that means money
Have you ever seen bling, bling when it aint sunny?
This aint funny they cant hold me down
Big bad wolf cant blow me down
Every bad bitch wanna blow me now
Oh you know me now oh you my homie now
I get dumb stooey in yo face
Hop out the benz wit the Louie briefcase
Cheapskate, fuck the price
You aint really cool if you aint got ice

[chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Dre gets whips shipped fresh off the dock
A mafia type, drink scotch on the rocks
The weed man love me, I cop quarter pops
Do a donut on the cops, fuck the shocks, make the car hop
Shake me locks, all the hoes jock
I make them robots, they bring me swoll knots
I bring them show knocks, boy Dre spit heaters
Fo' door mop' shots, dont fuck wit two seaters
I fuck wit two heaters identical twins
And if I aint feelin' the hen, man I'm killin the gin
Rhyme stealin' agian,
Dime stealin' agian,
Stab the blood out a nigga like I'm still in the pin,
Ughh,
Elvis ex-b,
Fuck her if she sexy,
I fuck with [? ] up,
Fuck with quinn and messy,
C.R.E.S.T. the bay I'm mapin' this,
Niggas start slappin' this,
Asapin' this,

[chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Man there go the police,
I'm not trippin',
I'm too legit to quit an I'm sqeaky clean pimpin',
If they see me when I'm dippin' I got L's to bargin(?),
An a square bitch with me to the take the charges,
I'm fly as a partridge,
Keep an extra cartridge,
Down like linoleum,
Rugs an carpets,
When I park it,
Ughh,
The benz rims still spin,
An on market an o'farrell,
I still pimp,
You still rent? I got four payed fo',
It's mac dre-ghost,
Takin' yo pesos,
Cause I like gravy on my potatoes,
Rap an break hoes, that's how my day goes,
On fire like Diego, I'm outta control,
An like KC cheese, I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll like the greyhound bus,
The hoes hound us, an always surround us,
The adam's marked suite, is where they found us,
It's home run hits, no flys or groundaz.Man who got this
Oh don't worry bout it nigga just pass the weed
You're here suckin' up all the weed,
mouth looks like it's a box of powdered donuts
We're real dumb in here with the Louie's

In this time of bammer weed
As a Louie I know just what I need (What ya' need cuddie)
I need an eighth of sticky gooey
and when I get this eighth I'm blowin with the Louie
Help me out
(Repeat 2x)

7 a.m. in the mornin and the monkey's at my bed
Got me cravin' and enslavin' I need some dope for my head

And I be kickin Backwood's fore' I hit the hood no doubt
Monkey on my back turnked out

Cause It's 3.5 on my rictor scale
And if the sack aint obese you wont make the sale

I need an eighth big body's sayin
When you bring my shit make sure my shit aint hay

Cause if it's hay when you bring it
I'ma get to wingin ghetto bling blingin leave a nigga head ringin
Fo show 3.5 of indo

Cause heads turn and bitches scream
when my man he pulled out that sticky green
It was sticky gooey residuey
one more time for my niggas in the looie

I can't spend over satchie that could buy me too much weed
As a louie I need gooey cause the gooey's what I need

And they be rollin fat vegas we stayed smokin' major
and niggas wanna hate us because we straight playas

But ask them other niggas bout my crew and what we doin and
We blowin crypt and that's the motherfuckin truth man
Ya know man we aint no Kurt Dogg's flowin big things turf hoggs
Hit the block blowin Backwoods and sew it up like a mac should you know
And Sugarwolfeezy off the heezy eat em' up best belive me with the louie's
And it was Dubee comin' through on the sticky gooey biotch

Grab the bud get the scissors and cut it
Grab the razor the blunt must be gutted
Up the middle like a fullback
You know we recycle the contact

I the dogg bitch I'm a smokin major
need a fast sack better hit me on my pager
Dub all's and ten sacks

Hello

Hey man when the fuck is you comin' man
Man three minutes

I need an eighth know what I mean (I got some killer brown)
Don't want no Bobby Brown I want Al Green
Gonna hit this Bobby come around I need that shit from Humboldt County
420 Airaqui shit that make you cough up snot
Three and a half no more no less in a Backwood it a bust ya chest
To have a grown man cryin tears sayin damn I aint been this high in years
That Indo only in Cali grown and we've got fat sacks in a Valley Joe
Blowin' big bomb at my house and leavin niggas stuck with cotton mouth
I need an eighth

That shit taste hella goodI'm in motion

Peep game, I started like this
I'm nothin' ****** nice with the mic in my fist
Never slackin when I'm mackin, get straight to the point
And always got my damn lighter to the mothafuckin' joint
Mac Dre, dope as you ever knew
Taxin muthafuckas like Internal Revenue
Knocken 'em off the top like it ain't no thang
Suckers cant hang with the way I slang
Ryhmes flow smooth like milk fom a cup
Straight cussin when I'm bustin' don't be givin a fuck
'Cause there's no room for weak and soft ones
Square muthafuckas end up lost ones
I'm the type of brotha that you don't wanna see
Mobbin on the S T A G E
Doper then a joint a that D A N K
Got more soul then Koonta Kinte
Young playa', down for the mail
Even bustin' tapes when they put me in jail
Straight, from the C E double L
Nevertheless, funky fresh, boy I'm never stale
Pumpin your brain up with game gettin' groovy'en
Doper then a key of that pure Peruvian
Uncut, dope as x-rated
Some hate it 'cause they cant relate
But I'm takin' out every time
'Cause sucka, slayin is a full time job
Not one to brag, but to tell you the truth mayne
I'm funkier than a locker room after a hoop game
To put it to you straight, I'm one nice dream
I'll make your brain, melt like ice cream
Given it to you just the way you like to be gave to
You never hear Dre do or say what they do
'Cause I'm no biter, Ill just write a
Rap that caps on a young sucka that might a
Step outta line, dissin' a ryhme
becomin Mac Dre is like commitin a crime
Ill best the rest, but test the best
But nevertheless the funky fresh, rizaps
makin' lots of snizaps
Suckas try to hang, Ill make a tape fizat
But some take no?, try to throw those
Slightly dope raps but I just show those
Suckas sudden death, I never slowly kill
Knocken 'em off the box like Evander Holyfield
I cant be touched when I'm on the microphone
Ill make sucka MC's leave the mic alone
One by one, they all bow down
And get riggidy romped out to this Mac Dre sound
Sometimes I cuss but whenever I bust
I keep the fans geeked and they cant get enough
Like a dope fiend hooked on the glass pipe
Or an alchoholic hooked on the ack-right
My raps make love to your ear hole
it's the diggity dope shit you love to hear, hoe

I'm in motion

Saucey, yes I got flava
When I'm ****** it up man nothin' can save ya
droppin' the funky **** like a A duble S hole
Romper room soldier comin' straight from the Crest hoe
Hotter then hot sauce, love to cock toss
Bitches get sprung when I'm gettin' my rocks off
'Cause I'm not the type that be bustin' quick ones
I like to hit the cock in all positions
From the back, or with the ***** on top
With young Mac Dre, mayne, it just don't stop
There ain't a piece of pussy that I cant get
Hoes on my dick like stank on ****
They just love they way, I T A L K
Your so saucey, Is what they tell Dre
Then ten minutes later they be wantin' to G this
Jealous muthafuckas be hatin' to see this
Player haters try, to salt me up
doin' punk ****, to fault me up
But that bullshit don't faze me
Shes still sprung, and she still pays me
With the quickness, she ain't hesitant
Given up them dead presidents
That lovey dovey **** I just cant get with
I charge hoes for this black big dick
Fly young tenders with lots of green
Be kickin' me down like a slot machine
breakin' me off somethin' more than propper
Young Mac Dre's a cold cash clocker
Not the type of brother that be tastin hoes
I'm the type of ***** that be lacin hoes
'Cause the ***** ain't **** but five letters
She don't kick down, then I sweat her
Mack the *****, crack the *****, break her
She wont pay then mayne I shake her
'Cause money makes the world spin
**** a wife and a girlfreind
it's all about S N A P S
A ***** thats broke, just ain't fresh
Some ****** think they gotta pay
**** that ****, not Mac Dre
Ill tell 'em like this, it costs to toss me
'Cause ain't no *****, that damn saucey
Hoes get sprung on the S E X
And don't hesitate given up the cheques

Like GadeazIt was a hot night in August, (hot August night), humid
Hit the store to get some O.J. to shroom with
Ooh shitty, I'm in the world's biggest little city
Seen a girl with some big ass titties
Top notch sadditty, punk bitch knew she was pretty
Get goosed in the city, get your purse took
When I stepped in her life she felt the earth shook
Before I spit the first hook, let me lace ya
Fucked her, had her crying like somebody maced her
Gave her a taste of some real macaroni
She swore she would do, anything for me
That's no bologne, baby brought me bread
Freaked me on the freeway on the 80 gave me head
She neva seen, a savage in Tims
Push a S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

Listen, you wouldn't want to miss this
I met this bitch the night before Christmas
Baby made my hitlist Christmas night
She let a nigga hit by Christmas lights
This bitch was tight, just my type
Barely ripe ride a dick like a bike
Eat a dick like pipe quick late night hype
Them the kind of thangs that makes my night
The steak ain't right without the A-1
So I stay dipped in sauce and they come
Like baby did, like that nigga old lady did
Like Karen, Kameka, and Katie did
It's crazy kid
Mommy on my bozac, I'm pimpin and she knows that, nigga wher the hoes at
Bet she neva seen, a sav in Tims
Push a S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

Me and black jesus went to Rosaritas
Seen senoritas eating carnitas
I was rocking my adidas sneakers
Told the waitress give my fajitas
Gold teethas, never speechless
Gave me the number with a Fairfield prefix
Dipped to the cougar, put up the ruger
In the stash spot, a wise maneuver
Put up the cougar, pulled out the MB
California Hot Boy, MD
The boss, that do the firing and hiring
Sweat a broad, I keep them prespiring
She's admiring the way I slide
The way I ride, and her boyfriend lied
She neva seen a sav in Tims
Push a S5 sittin' on some Davin rims

She only see's me with European keys
She only see's me with woodgrain sprees
She only see's me with Champelli trees
She only see's me having hella G'sf/ Lil Bruce

[ CHORUS ]
[ Mac Dre ]
Cause I'm the Chevy man
The Chevy man?
Yes, I'm the Chevy man
[ Lil Bruce ]
I'm a Ford man
Mob in my old school because I can
I'm a Ford man
Tryin to figure eight with a blunt in my hand

[ VERSE 1: Mac Dre ]
My partner got a ElCo, my homie got a 'Maro
He Mexicano, might rock a sombrero
My cuzzo got a Mali' sittin on Rally's
He candy green, might've seen him in the Valley
My uncle got a Imp', he a pimp
96 in the flow when he hide behind a tint
My auntie got a 'Vette so tight she might wreck
My cuddy got a candy Nova, he hella wet
My granny got a 'Burban, not an Excursion
Gramps got a Silverado, Stepside version
My nigga Nate got a C-28
And if the rollers get behind him, boy, he finna shake
My folks got a glasshouse and when he mash out
I crack the heem and pull the grass and the hash out
Catch Dre in a trey, revvin it
Please believe it, I'm always Chev'in it

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Lil Bruce ]
I hit the California coast in a California Mustang
Shelby drop-top so hot on them gold thangs
I get the thumbs up, I like that old school Ford
I got the 64 Falcon, all original, restored
Sports coupe Sprint, not a ding or a dent
390 V8, you didn't know they made them
With my XR-7 70 work convertable
429 Cobra Jet unservable
I'm a Ford man, never bored, man, I got collection
Smash on a Chevy, then I smoke the intersection
Give us a parking lot and let the sideshow commence
Young niggas lose on the impounds and dents
High speeds, I knows all about em
Old school veteran, Lil Bruce straight clownin
I slap my shit on low and let the rollers feel my pan
They know they can't see me cause I be the Ford man

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
[ Lil Bruce ]
This is high speed chase play, I'm first on race day
I'm at the stoplight with my cutthroat Mac Dre
[ Mac Dre ]
I'm at the light on slicks pushin on the throttle
SS 400 small rock Monte Carlo
[ Lil Bruce ]
69 Falcon lights squarer than my first hoe
427 with the fo' on the flo'
[ Mac Dre ]
Yeah, you lookin hella clean and kinda mobby
But my gears snatch quick with this 12 valve Posie
[ Lil Bruce ]
Yeah, I like your Caddy but I'ma blow your do's
I got the 750 double pump Holly on flows
[ Mac Dre ]
(? ) lifters, B&M; shifter
Nitrous oxide make the Chevrolet swifter
[ Lil Bruce ]
Trick flowin hearse with the nitrous burst
Make the sports coupe fly and the Chevy boys cry
[ Mac Dre ]
I got ported aluminum heads, I'm hella fast
Your Ford's in my rearview, I'm seein checker flags-Mac Dre-
I'm the kind of nigga that'll come through and yoke on you
Burnin rubber in the shitnell, with the 4-0-2
Dippin, dashin, smashin
Through the traffic
Smokin, chokin, hopin,
I rap it
Cuz my candy's look wet, three coats of clear
Miami's on deck with three quartes of beer
Clownin all the freaks but he still gets jocked
Bouncin in the seat while the 15's knock
I'm dipped in butter everybody jocks my style
Cal hat pulled down to my eyebrow
Polo geared down
I'm in her ear now
Stealin it, she's feelin it, its all clear now
One more hoe, on my team
I'm a pimp homeboy, what do you mean
Its all about scrilla in the land of thugs and killers
Gangstas, pimps, players, and drug dealers
Chorus 2x
If you, wanna fuck with me
Be about yo doe, I gots to have doe
I just want to let you know
Its 2 in the morning and I'm still chasin cash
Other niggaz in the club, still chasin ass
Fuck theezat
I'm all about my screezatch
I got my fishing pole out trying to ceezatch
A big fish, I'm hungary, need a big bitch
I'ma bump a bitch with the quickness
Boy its just pimpin in my blood
Bitches, they all give him love
The Mac name Dre bitch, take it easy
You fuckin wit a street nigga thats greasy
I'll buck yo brotha, fuck yo motha
Keep it on the DL, its all undercover
I'm a hustler bitch, I pull capers
I only fuck with thugs that get paper
Chips, chedda, scrilla, real niggaz, killaz, and drug dealers
Chorus 2x
24 hours, 7 days a week
I do my thug thang, playin in them streets
But the game I play really aint no joke
Come around my way and you might get smoked
Bullet proof vest's, Chevy SS's
Come through in a bucket
The next day in a Lexus
It's a ghetto life
I don't have no wife
Boy I'm married to the game and I handle my
Business, I'm in this for the money not the honey
Square bitches spooked, they all run from me
Dummy, bitch, if you knew better, you do better
I'ma stay on bitch back like new sweaters
Mac Dre baby
Quit talkin crazy
When you get about some money
Its all gravy
Ask my last bitch square, that's all realla
I only fuck with pimps, killaz and drug dealers
Chorus 2xim bout to get it right bubblin all night, hustlin, man thats most of my life, f tues and thurs im out on the streets,

Bitch, life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die

It's not often young niggas get a chance
To enjoy riches in legitimate fashion
So many of us say fuck it get a bucket
And run up in something and keep smashing

It's all about survival but jealous rivals
Make it hard for us to do this
So everybody got a gun but when we was younger
Our only weapon was our two fists

Now who missed the first lesson in life don't be no punk
If you a man have heart be a savage whether you sober or drunk
I seen niggas in the pen getting
Their ass dug out over some hop or a pack of Camels

But that's the game home boy and every move you make is a gamble
Them squares don't under stand so it takes niggas like me to explain
I show vengeance violence and hatred
Because underneath it's so much pain
I ain't no sissy or punk so don't trip when you see me cryin'

A nigga just hella mad his partners is dead and his folks keep on dying
My enemies feel the same way they want me dead
They think I'm the nigga that put they partner 6 feet under
And left his son with no father figure

I live day by day not giving a fuck
And when they ask me why
I pause for a minute then I reply
Because life's a bitch and then you die

Bitch, life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch then you die
Nigga don't want a whole slice just let me taste the pie
They sent me to the pen for five years
For a crime that was never committed

I ain't no bank robber but that five years
Had me thinking maybe I should have did it
Do my thoughts deceive me? What a mutherfucker supposed to think
Locked down, trapped looking at four walls a toilet bowl and a sink

Ain't that a bitch I've been struggling ever since I could remember
But I stay strong year round from January all the way to December
See I am a hustler I need cash bad as a fat bitch need jogging
So I specialize in three things and that's pimping, hogging and dogging

Half these suckers walking around here fake as three dollar bills
If you with that bullshit don't come around me
I do this for reals not for thrills
I got to watch my back for them suckers that's out to do harm

Got a tattoo of a list full a partners
That's dead that run all the way down my arm
So If you see me mugging tripping and bugging
Don't stop and ask me why
A nigga just hella mad because life's a bitch and then you die

Bitch, life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die

I got a crew full of the realest that's deep as the Pittsburgh Steelers
Retired bank robbers, ex-dope dealers and adversary killers
Our mission is simple get rich and stay real nigga
So our kids can live fat, better then we did when we was little niggas

Life is short you only live once and ain't no telling when your leaving
So I'm going to do it all have a ball while I'm still living and breathing
See I am a philosopher and my philosophy is this
Don't be no punk young homey, if it's worth it take that risk

Anything's possible but nothings for sure
Got to take advantage of all opportunities and get your money you know
Love those who love you but don't never let it fuck up your vision
How much love did your loved ones have
When you was broke or doing time in prison

Stay on your toes don't fuck with hoes before you read them
Watch your back for them rats that set niggas up to keep they freedom
It takes 365 days for the earth to spin one time
But it only takes one minute
For that guilty verdict when that snitch drops that dime

A damn shame I thought rat heads get nothing but cheddar
But I got partners doing all day with 35 next to that letter
So I'm in trouble unless I bubble so I struggle to keep my peace
Staying money motivated with thoughts of Mike Robinson and D.J. Cee

Bitch, life's a bitch
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you dieRain on em

Hate To Sound Sexist But You All Gay
Quit Using That Oil Of Olay
Mac Dre A Lone Desperado
Who Gonna Press The Thottle If The Boys Try Ta Follow
My Boys Got The Hollows They Hurt When They Hit Ya
Leave Me Lone When You Gone Off That Purp And The Liquor
Nigga Im a Grown Ass Man 
Tryna Live Off The Fat Of The Lamb
Procede As Planned Stay Focused
Is't Dreganomics I Got Doses (Come On)

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
Uh Dreganomics (Dreganomics?)
It's Dreganomics (Dreganomics?)
Dreganomics (Dreganomics?)
It's Dreganomics (It's Dreganomics)
Yea Boy 
Ronald Dregan
I Campaign With This Game Mane
Yadidimean
And i Will Let You Norega Types
Bring It Across For The Right Price
Feel Me Family
Yeah Dreganomics I Got DosesCome on everybody let's all get down
To this old-school sound with that K-Lou pound
It goes a 1-2-3, 3 to 2-1
Can't leave my house without packin my gun
I see niggaz dying
Mamas crying
They say "keep packing Dre" I said "ugh, you lying"
Man, I hope they don't try to strike him out
Have him doing big time in Suzy's house
Hard times is coming to my town
Graduated from the pen, no cap and gown
Cause back in '85, school was soup
I rolled in trues and vogues, so I sold goop
Oops-up-side my head
Next thing I know, I'm doing time in the feds
Big spreads- with macks and killas
415s and Black Gorillas
On the rilla -ugh- it's nothing pretty
Can't get caught slipping laying under the titty
Gotta be a savage, can't be no jerk
Boy, I do's dirt
And I'm a cold piece of work
You's a smirk
And you're scared to get down
You better do the hokey-pokey and turn yourself around clown
It's going down
I thought you smelt it
Niggaz PH-in and they just can't help it
I keep sucka-reppelent
Cause suckas is tellin
Keep it coming out they throat, I grab my coat and I'm bailing
Two years ago- a cuddy of mine
Had to do some time 'cause a nigga dropped a dime
I'm super-sucka-free
And they can't fuck with me
Cause I'm a R-O-M-P from the C-R-E-S-T
We- gets dumb
You know how we come
Making up words like shitty-run-fun
Shitty-run-fun? Yeah, is you with me?
That's when your stomach is bubbling and your booty is drippy
Sticky, gooey
Smoke it with the Louie
Step in the throne looking real rag-gooey
Oooowwheeee...! that's how I sound
So come on everybody, let's all get down[Chorus]
Can you shout?, Let me hear you scream
We some fiends, for demon sticky green
Can you shout?, Let me hear you scream
We some fiends, for demon stick green
We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, make the police on high speeds
We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, make the police on high speeds
Policeman got me on the run (policeman got me on the run)
Knowin' damn well that I'm not the one (knowing damn well I ain't the one)
Errywhere I go I gotta take my gun (errywhere I go I gotta take my gun)
Errybody know that I'm they doe when I just tryin' to have some fun, Can you dig it?
[Chorus]
Put the guns in the trunk, come and listen to some slump
You never know cuddie, you might bump
A silver dolla, tryin to holla
Put'ya in a Benz, get'cha out that Impala
Pop a colla, Nah that's old
Dust yourself off, like bases been stole
I so cold, I'm so cool
Call me Morris Dre the Cutthoat fool
We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, make the police on high speeds
We don't like broke bitches, We don't like brown weed
We don't like no snitches, make the police on high speeds
Policeman got me on the run (policeman got me on the run)
Knowin' damn well that I'm not the one (knowing damn well I ain't the one)
Errywhere I go I gotta take my gun (errywhere I go I gotta take my gun)
Errybody know that I'm they doe when I just tryin' to have some fun
Can you dig it?Rat-tat-tat
[ VERSE 1: Mac Dre ]
I grew up in the Bay Area, around a gang of robbin and shootin
Looked up to legends like Felix Mitchum, Huey P. Newton
And Todd Shaw a/k/a Too $hort
Blowin big hashis with dank that'll make you choke
Young Mac Dre, causin major damage
Back in the days I tossed hoes in the back of my ham sandwich
Grown, gone, on bomb seed that's hemp
Hound for potential prostitutes who need a pimp
But now I'm bendin corners, fresh out Taradas
Chokin on roper in the back of the Nada
Drinkin that snake bite, Yukon jack
And boy, I ain't ride without my strap
Cause them cutthroat bandits will split yo wig
In the streets of Killafornia, ya dig?
It's goin down, dog, I'm in your town, dog
Got to let your peeps know how I clown, dog
In the end get it, comin with that blackhand sound
You thinkin I can't clown? Let me put my mack hand down
[ CHORUS ]
[ Killa ] How yo hood look?
[ Dre ]It's full of gangsters, fool
How yo hood look?
[ Killa ]It's full of gangsters, son
You can catch me on the Eastside, doin my thing
[ Killa ]Or you can me in New York, boy, it's all the same
[ VERSE 2: Killa ]
I'm from the Eastside, where the thugs, they shed blood for nothin
After the club you get it in your mug if you frontin
We gangbang, it's just that our slang's a little different
Aim a little different, spit game a little different
Got in with the Mexicans, pricin them things a little different
Same kinda crooks, but we cook up bricks a little different
Them old school Chevrolets, our Six Range a little different
Y'all gats and guns the same, but we blow brains a little different
Them drive-by's, we walk-by's, some die a little different
Lie a little different, testify a little different
Y'all trees ain't got seeds, y'all beez a little different
The d's is different, my pee's a little different
Y'all sell bricks, we break it down, get cheese a little different
Y'all hate narcs, we hate cops, we eat a little different
Y'all got strips, we got spots, our blocks a little different
It get hot a little different, fools get knocked a little different
When the feds came, yo Dre, they took the whole block to prison
My man pops was snitchin, his face chopped in Clinton
If you got change and the gear hot, then switch spots, get missin
Yo hood ain't no different, my hood ain't no different
[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3 ]
[ Dre ]
In my neighborhood everybody thuggin
Hoodrats steady gettin dug in
Fools buggin, mean-muggin
Later on you seem em noggin
[ Killa ]
Dre, I play my hood all day
Seen a fool get killed in broad day
Thugs get money from the hallway
2 for 5, the tall way
[ Dre ]
Ghetto slang, ghetto game
We all just doin that ghetto thang
Run around totin them metal thangs
Really, homeboy, it's all the same
[ Killa ]
Yo hood is like my hood, son
Anywhere you go thugs pullin guns
Gangbangers, ghetto birds
Yo hood is like my hood, ya heard?
[ Dre ]
Me and Killa finna leet you know
How to put a lick down and get some dough
>From yo hood to Mexico
Cause it's all about that paper, though
[ Killa ]
Put me up with Vallejo hoe
That puff on hay, stay on the low
Dre got work, 800 to 0
Eastside thugs make money, you know?
[ Dre ]
I don't care where we at
Just as long as we keep smokin fat
Get a fifth of Hen and hopin that
Everybody wanna stay chokin, black
[ Killa ]
I told you, Dre, our hood ain't changed
Thuggin em well, slingin em things
Fools rock Rolies and diamond rings
Respect the game, our hood's the same
[ CHORUS ]
