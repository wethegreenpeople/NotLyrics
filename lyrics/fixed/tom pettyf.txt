Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah but I was so much older then.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
"Rip down all hate", I screamed.

Romantic facts of musketeers.
Foundationed deep, somehow.

A self-ordained professor's tongue.
Too serious to fool.
Spouted out that liberty.

"Equality", I spoke the word.
As if a wedding vow.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand.
At the mongrel dogs who teach.
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy.
In the instant that I preach.

My pathway led by confusion boats.
Mutiny from stern to bow.

Too noble to neglect.
Deceived me into thinking.
