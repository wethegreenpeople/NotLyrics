See most cats treat her like foofer.
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the super.
You need to make her feel cuter.
And lay down the G like Luther, everything will be super.

Blessed with a hot flow, tested and got doe.
Invested and stressed the best to finesse a opto.

Hot as hell and it's a cold day in it.
Working on a way that we go roll away tinted.
Some say the price of holdin' heat is often too high.
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy.

The one that's too fly to eat shoe pie, never too busy.
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I.
Swear to God, a lot of niggaz wish to die.

When I was four I pen God was born in New York.
Back in seventy seven still got nan in the crescent.
The effervescence of God's presence is thick.
Unlike vapor, escarole, extra roll, word to the baker.
Peace to the hard workin' ginger bread makers.

Looked her up and down, said, â€½Hmm, too much makeupâ€.
Poor music taste, ten years from being grown up.
Rappers don't blow up heads, do, aw shit.

Barely born a virgin is what the stars said.
Black not white, red all over though like Elmo.
Twenty eight years have passed, I feel I'm peakin'.
I make music every weekend.

It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love.
I get mad love but I detest the labor.

Hittin' on many trees, feel real linen.
Spittin' on enemies, get the steel for tin men.

With no brains but gum flap.
He said his gun clap then he fled after one slap.
Pat, son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches.

Break it rollin' through your hood in the caddy buggy.
Butter softy, leather flossy, fatty juggy.
Always threw me off when she told me, â€½Daddy, funk meâ€.

I'm like anywho's.
Seeds walkin' all out in street without any shoes.
I guess it's better than some funky socks.
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pocks.

Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock.
Sing it, bring it back to your laboratory.
While he's in his oratory, glorious like a horror story.

Break the mic like a rock star, break a guitar.
Jump off the stage like, yee hawBeef rap could lead to gettin' teeth capped.
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap.
I suggest you change your diet.
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it.
.
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease.
It ain't no startin' back once arteries start to squeeze.
Take the easy way out, phony, until then they know.
They wouldn't be talkin' that bologna in the bullpen.

Top bleeding, maybe fellow took the loaded rod gears.
Stop feeding babies colored, sugar coated lard squares.
The odd pairs swears and God fears.
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years.
.
I wrote this note around New Year's.
Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares.
Enough about me, it's about the beats.
Not about the streets and who food he about to eat.
.
A rhymin' cannibal who's dressed to kill, it's cynical.
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral.
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical.
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual.

Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale.
.
Light the doobie â€~til it glow like a ruby.
After which they couldn't find the villain like Scooby.
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit.
Overproof drunk shit and who'da thunk it.
.
Punk, try and ask why ours be better.
It could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater.
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD nudeBefore we go any further, friends.
.
As you call â€~em they call you when they need somethin'.
Trees for the blunt, two G's for the front.
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone.
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone.
.
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life.
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife.
At least so you could see the white of their eyes.
Bright with surprise once they finish spittin' lies.
.
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggaz, homies?.
Close, but really don't know me.
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies.
Some come around when they need some money.
.
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies.
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy.
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me.
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy.
.
So nowadays he ain't so friendly.
Actually they wouldn't even made a worthy enemy.
Read the signs, no feeding the baboon.
Seein' as how they got your back bleeding from the stab wounds.
.
Y'all know the dance, they smile in your face, y'all know the glance.
Try ta put 'em on, they blow the chance.
Never let your so-called mans know your plans.
How many of us have them? A show of hands.
.
Friends is a term some people use loosely.
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see.
You telling me, I try to act broke.
Jealousy, the number one killer among black folk.
.
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke.
Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc.
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end.
I check the dictionary for the meanin' of â€~Friends'.
.
It said, person, one who likes to socialize with.
Sympathize and help her and that's about the size of it.
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided.
To bolster the crime they opt to shoot you through your eyelid.
.
And they can't hide it goin' wild like a white bitch.
Sometimes you need to cut niggaz off like a light switch.
Click, and when things get quiet.
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, bow, what a riot.
.
I first met Mister Fantastik at a arms deal.
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms will feel.
When it get for real the steel get to sparkin'.
Everything darken and ain't no talkin'.
.
For somethin' so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble.
You better off focusing than tryin' to plot the bubble.
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got.
One's we can depend on, friends.
.
Some come in the form of co-dependence.
A lotta times only end up bein' co-defendants.
Ten bucks say they'll tell for a lower sentence.
And leave you up under the jail beggin' for a penance.
.
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?.
Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty.
I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory.
How many of us have a similar story, friends?.
.
Before lovers we used to have some type of over standing.
Just so when I let her get the man-thing she know it's no strings.
We could do the damn thing but, hoe, it's no rings.
Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?.
.
That depends on how good was the skins.
And could she memorize the lessons.
It ain't no need to pretend.
Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just, friends.
.
Friends, how many of us have them?.
Friends, ones we can depend on?.
Friends, how many of us have them?.
Friends, before we go any furtherYeah, here we go, just go with the flow.
Yeah, here we go, just go with the flow.

Son, stop cryin'.
Frontin' like you death-defyin'.
You need to stop lyin'.

This is it, make no mistakes.
Where my nigga go?.
Figaro, Figaro.
.
O's beats and my rhymes attack.
A scary act.
All black like Ms. Mary Mack.
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano.
DOOM sings soprano like "una duociano" (singing voice).
My momma told me.
Blast him and pass her her glass of Ol' E.
Not to be troublesome.
But I could sure use a quick shot of double rum.
No stick of bubble gum.
I like ice cream.
We could skip the weddin'.
Have a nice dream.
She only let him stick the head inYo.
I'm only rhyming where the drums is at.
Y'all niggaz think y'all slick wit that bullshit bump that.
Y'all pay V for flowing to the beat.
Not for what he know that got hoe's hoeing in the streets.
That's for him to know and for they to never find out.
.
About the kidnap, blind fold, and the blind mouse.
The coroner report say he simply signed out oh.
And I know.
Y'all wanna see a wino bring the wine out.
Cat wit a dead mouse is how he catch the phrase.
And pause plays wit it kill it.
And eat off it for days kid it.
.
Who ever ain't get it ain't supposed to.
For standing still close to.
Bandits will ghost you no shoot Sherlock.
I don't know how they do on your block.
.
Out here we rock on to the sure shot.
Shit still ain't stop keep it on till your peeps is gone.
We be on the creep no matter what you keep it on.
CD whop.
.
Peep catch the beat to ridiculously.
People think he study levitations true mystery.
How to power an envious scallon till.
He got him for his sweet 16.
He said Ed be wilding.
.
Rumor has it things got violent.
He clobbered him and broke the fuck out.
But he ain't try to rob him.
I told her don't tell your man that's.
The trouble with these chicks.
Next experiment.
.
Twelve strands from double helix.
No I haven't seen Kess Felix.
Oh, yeah.
You stay away from her with those lyrics.
Please.
Ain't nobody fucking after her.
.
I'm out of here as soon as I fix the flux capacitor.
N O N and speak to V in a proper manner.
Before he stabs ya and put out all type of proper gander.
Stop the slander chop the hand of a thief.
And cut the mouth off of who ever comes out they teeth.
.
V sell time to an inmate.
And then tell him a rhyme for the hell of it to demonstrate.
They know who's the renown beat critic.
Do a street lyric like that's a neat trick.
Off on a tangent he ain't got a cent.
.
Supposed to go to management.
And spent it getting bent sparky.
I had enough of your malarkey.
For one don't mark me and who you calling darky.

What's the hero, who's the villain?.
Dead or livin, killed or killin, who the fuck should remain chillin?.
(Doom) Webster says, wicked and evil, but yo who's Webster?.
Nihilation and outcast, equals freedom that's so fast.
Culture in chains, that be the rolls villain plays.
All these are just metaphors, they describe symbols in folklore.
But who knows why it's like this?.
Hero? Hit or old miss? Maybe it's all good.
Really of God, but who should, determine the real.
Evil, what's the deal.
Fools rush in, they don't know the yin, from the yang.
And are ashamed to deviate, or act sane.
From the norm, they are slaves, forced to conform.
To really find your essence, take this as a lesson.
Break away from the rest of them.
Get from the form ending, like the villain in the song.
Find truth, who determines wrong.
From right, without a fistfight.
Different from day than from night {Operation... Doomsday}.
It's just a simple play on words.
Delete all these punks ass herbs.
Who's the hero, what's the villain?.
The question still remains chillin.
Listen to the music, try very hard to use it.
Open up and research, and that's the end of this verse.
But y'all niggas keep y'all minds open out there.

"Nah man, that shit is fucked up man, that shit can get us busted over here man!".
"Relax man it's for the paper".

[Intro: MF Doom singing].
It never really mattered too much to me.
That I was just too damn old to emcee.
All that really matters is if your rhymes was ill.
Girl, that's all that really mattered to me, oh baby.
.
[MF Doom].
Looks like it's gonna be a great day today.
To get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway.
Hey you, got a light? Nah, a Bud Light.
Early in the morning, face crud from like a mud fight.
Lookie here, it's just the way the cookie tear.
Prepare to get hurt and mangled like Kurt Angle rookie year.
The rocket scientist, with the pocket wine list.
Some even say he might need some p-sychiatrist.
DOOM, are you pondering what I'm pondering?.
Yes, but why would the darn thing be wandering?.
She's like a foundling, barely worth fondling.
My posse's on Broadway like Mama I Want to Sing.
Mad plays the bass like the race card.
Villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred.
Groovy, dude! Not to prove to be rude.
But this stuff is like what you might put on movie food.
Uh, what is jalapeños?.
Get it like a whuppin' when you holla at your seniors.
Dolla he can overhear the hashish vena.
He just came from over there, the grass is greener.
Last wish: I wish I had two more wishes.
And I wish they fixed the door to the matrix, there's mad glitches.
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches.
One thing this party could use is more... booze.
Put yourself in your own shoes.
And stay away from all those pairs of busted Timbs you don't use.
He only keep 'em to decorate.
If you wanna peep him, select a date.
And bring a deep check, like "Check, mate".
I kid you not, on the dotted line signed.
Ever since a minor, kids considered him some kind of Einstein.
On a diamond mine grind, she was dumb fine.
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine.
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick.
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick.
On second thought, it's too thick.
His assistant said: "Doom, you sick," he said "True" through acoustics.
Psycho, his flow is drowned in Lawry's seasoning.
With micropower he's sound and right reasoning.
It's easy as pi, 3.14.
One more one false move and they're done for.
Indefinitely, concieved in LKC,.
See Archangel in Infinities, white T reeking of Hennessy,.
brought back memories, father locked north up,.
Mom's snort up her crack remedy,.
lack remedies be just what I did,.
no school, no cool.
No fool, but fuck politics,.
Dead prez educated hit shit I lit the dollars with,.
Hard Boiled, Chow Yum,.
Fat boiled hard since six,.
Rather on a brick during class,.
my ass'd never sit,.
and give a, fuck bout Hitler,.
Caesar, Ask the teacher,.
why am I need of knowing this?.
Cant you tell the judge hold my books,.
and I'm the crook on his corner, bitch?.
"Rolling fats with Chronomats shining on my wrist?".
Til, I got caught up by all the law's of his,.
Incarcerated cause Tre's and stained papes and weight,.
yeah, I was harboring,.
Got out to find out,.
neighbour kids'd been fathered in,.
Water of repentance used for college of the selling,.
Live from proudest felons marking lives with dots,.
and popping off on em like melons,.
fuck that now, man I'm grown and shit,.
Fuse Mic's like dynamite but never bomb.
This rap shit, I find credits in,.
route blocked by hoes, past the prime elegance,.
Hobo's with kids clothes trading them off for medicine,.
One goal is all's endevour, man,.
alling is for weak,.
Dragged rags through my hall's ducking calls of the beast,.
Got away, I'm clean and debt free,.
I ball, ya best believe,.
Box the socks off ya, Heavy Weight G stopper,.
but all bars and heavy beats,.
ain't got me away from my scars and memories,.
()Yo, yo, yo, y'all can't stand right here.
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare.
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range.
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange.
I sell rhymes like dimes.
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times.
Joker rhymes, like the "Is you just happy to see me?" trick.
Classical slap-stick rappers need Chapstick.
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show.
So I give 'em something to remember, like the Alamo.
Tally-ho! A high Joker like Spades game.
Came back from five year layin' and stayed the same.
Sayin' - electromagnetic feeling blocks all logic, Spock.
And G- shocks her biological clock.
When I hit it, slit her to the shitter, thought I killed her goose.
Her Power-Use was pure Brita water, filtered juice.
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe wit' 'im.
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write wit' 'im.
Never seen the shit again, but he's still my dunny.
Only thing that come between us is krill and money.
I sell rhymes like dimes.
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times.
Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not.
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along.
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks.
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks.
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe.
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro.
This rhyme flow take practice like Tae Bo.
With Billy Blanks.
Oh, you're too kind! Really, thanks..
To the gone and lost forever like "Oh My Darling Clementine".
He hold his heart when he tellin' rhymes.
When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven.
He's nasty like the old time Old Number Seven.
You still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola.
Make you wish they coulda erased out the Motorola.
I told her - no credit for it back.
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak.
Only in America could you find a way to make a healthy buck.
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct.

And you learn to hold on (hold on).
To things like the mic ... the mic.
.
And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device.
.
But who is [the finest]?.
.
[Tommy Gunn].
Time at shashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor.
Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor.
Time at shashuma, no time for humor.
As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead, you trying to find Pumas.
Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already.
Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather.
We ready to do whatever, yo' Doom you with it?.
.
(You know it like a poet, my brother).
(Hey, Gunn you wit it?) Whatever... [the finest!].
.
[MF Doom].
I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off.
To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: "Get the hell off".
Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off.
A show-off, he has the same bite but fell off.
I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts.
Which niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks.
Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell.
The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell.
.
[Tommy Gunn].
When die, he gon' die like a soldier die:.
Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold.
Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach.
Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die.
He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky.
.
[MF Doom].
Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup.
This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up.
I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up.
Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up.
.
[Megalon].
Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die.
He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes.
Got the weed, rolling lah.
Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply.
Within the prophecies hold the lie.
.
[MF Doom].
He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me.
OD, ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me.
A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed ....
.
Me ... sci-fly, whole style stuck up.
Used to talk to myself, I told him, "Shut the fuck up!".
Buckle up, cause it's about to be rough.
He said, "Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed".
Then we squashed it, I let em know: "Watch it --.
We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit".
Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance.
For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor.
.
[Megalon].
I pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what?.
Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up.
On the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up.
Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete.
Damn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already.
Can't stand you, understand you deadly.
But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy.
Yo' Doom, you ready?.
.
(Yeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it?) Whatever...
.
[MF Doom].
Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day.
Remind me of the same style I flipped on "Hey!".
Yikes! Who can fuck with the likes.
Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's.
Metal grill, with many styles, better still.
Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel.
And deal, and run rings around rhymers.
And run rings like number runners whose old-timers.
.
[Megalon].
Shorty in the all black, she think she all that.
I called her, she said, "Don't call back!".
She called me, now what you call that?.
Let's go back, I sold crack.
Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that.
Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at?.
.
[MF Doom].
Suffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash.
He love her, motherfuck her ass.
Metal feet dented your car fender.
My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender.
Is unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown?.
MF like Mike Fran Corleone.
And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at?.
An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act.
Raised by a pack a wild wolves, it's like Sweetback.
Front? I'mma be back! (Like brothers in the street act).
(Surrounded by a bunch a bad bitches like Sweetback).
(Fuck with me I'll be back).

[Verse 1].
Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped.
Or even a wreath for ma dukes on some grief crap.
I suggest you change your diet.
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it.
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease.
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze.
Take the easy way out phony, until then.
They know they wouldn't be talking that baloney in the bullpen.
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this.
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice.
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet.
Two batteries some Brillo and some foil, he'a boil it.
He be better off on PC glued.
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood.
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed.
(Food, we need food!).
.
[Verse 2].
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh.
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous.
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit.
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit.
Her bra smell, his card say: aw hell.
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel.
Keep a cooker where the jar fell.
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell.
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears.
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares.
The odd pair swears and God fears.
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years.
I wrote this note around New Year's.
Off a couple a shots and a few beers, but who cares?.
Enough about me, it's about the beats.
Not about the streets and who food he about to eat.
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical.
Whether is it animal, vegetable, or mineral.
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical.
And proceed to move the crowd like a old Negro spiritual.
For a mil' do a commercial for Mello Yello.
Tell 'em devil's hell no, sell y'all own Jello.
We hollow krills, she swallow pills.
He follow flea collar three dollar bills.
And squeal for halal veal, 80-dollar pill.
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal.
Twirl a L after every meal (FOOD!).
.
[Verse 3].
What up?.
To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up.
And keep your shirt on, at least a button-up.
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?.
Out of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales.
They chippin' nails, DOOM, tippin' scales.
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales.
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail.
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail, and sippin' ale.
Light the doobie 'till it glow like a ruby.
After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby.
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit.
Overproof drunk shit, and who would'a thunk it?.
Punk, try and ask why ours be better.
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater.
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude (We need food!) Produced By: MF DOOM.

Tossing, turning, dreams of murder, someone's killing me.
Of changes, there's nights I'm on a killing spree.
All done cold blood waking up in cold sweats.
This is such a cold world unconscious getting death threats.
Shadows choking me, my last breath lets out my body.
It's a conspiracy, my mind and my body's not really down with me.
Me against the whole world? It's a little deeper.
Me against my self, I fight the Grim Reaper.
Swing sickle, I got my Glock bust rounds off.
Demented, schizophrenic, I know this sounds off to you.
I do not lie, when I doze off spirits hope I die, whatever.
Angels waste the time, they work together.
Scheme and plot on me, cause I'm the son of man.
I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam.
Don't give a damn if the bullets fill me.
I don't wanna live, I hope they kill me.
Put me out my misery, I live in misery.
I kill all my enemies, cause I love company.
Those who seek me, are called wise men.
Or either wise-guys I pray you comprehend.
And realize I'm condemned.
.
No rest, homicidal dreams.
My cellmate, all he do is scream.
Out loud how he wants to go home.
That's funny, I'm here all alone.
Locked, in a single cell.
His back's bleeding, he's cold as hell.
And I'm hoping, they turn on some heat.
I call the C.O. to bring some extra sheets.
"Where'd he go?" he walk through walls, run halls, I pray "teach me".
They don't see him at the health they try to reach me.
I said "please see how he feels".
They said, "He's alright but he's not real".
Evaluations say I suffer from depression.
Hallucinations, self-creations what they're guessin'.
I'm here doing years, I'm stressin'.
Medicate me, sedate me want me to rest an'.
Don't take it cause he said that won't be best an'.
He said I need his help and he needs me.
"Nigga you walk through walls, go home you're free".
.
Home, that was far and he was turned off.
Cause his wings was burned off.
A lesson was learned, communicate with one.
I was chosen cause I'm God's son.
.
[MF Doom].
And I'm the retarded one!.
(*sings*) Out in the streets.
You won't survive with, wack-ass beats ("We can see that!").
These days and times.
Watch as we get ours with rhymes.
.
To my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast-iron.
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren.
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick.
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosovik.
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?.
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's.
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky.
At your local sleazy speak-easy.
For any fan of the limelight.
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite.
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale.
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail.
Jumpin Jehosaphat, who's that?.
Who cats who do magic be like "tell me how you do's that".
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like gecko.
Thought I might do techno.
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet.
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourettes.
Yet tight flow to make her bad-ass stutter.
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter.
Butter, word play since third grade age.
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage".
Hip hop Benny Hill's sip Henny straight, get every penny weighed, then he chill, at any rate.
My metal-face hoes with tongue or (at) least eye ring.
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing.
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting.
And the super-villain strike again like lightning.
In the same spot (bzzz!) now what's the chance of that?.
And a name-drop like pick the name out the hat.
That's a no jiver from the, liver conniver.
Who vote players out the rap game like Survivor while I.
Drop through greens like a nerd cat with intended speech from way back.
And spin on your back and then freeze.
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero.
So called rhymers, go call Cleo.
While I, steal the show like thought-so-try-hiking.
Super-duper stars need Ortho-TriCylin.
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women.
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain.
(Uhh, I hear voices).
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villainYeah.
Another love song gone wrong.
So know you are a WOOP.
Like based God in wonton.
But I didn't.
And I ain't even tripping.
Another foul ball.
But I'm still glad I hit it.
'Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know.
Coulda shoulda type like,.
"Oh, it was like, too tight".
Come on, I would've pipe.
But our schedules contradicted.
Well I was tied down hey pipe down.
First night ya boy laid the pipe down.
Took off the night gown.
And whipped out the slanky.
Then she screamed, "Joey spank me".
And after that she even thanked me, swanky.
One time for my nigga Dymes.
Lord knows we'll be kicking rhymes.
'Til the end of time.
But back to the topic.
Oh yeah I'm pissed off.
I'm still tripped off.
And wondering why shorty dipped off.
I ain't gonna front a nigga.
Do miss the lip gloss.
Now she sucked some next nigga dick off.
And my dick soft.
So tell me what the fuck I'm posed to do.
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you.
I sent the postcards so you know it's true.
I promise that I wouldn't get emotional.
And I'm not, so stop it.
Why you frontin like you don't miss my whole cock.
Pit down your esophagus.
Screaming, "daddy stop it".
Ripping out your tracks.
Chipped nail polish in the scratches of my back like.
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky roll.
And I tried to suck your titties whole.
For milk for my cheerios.
Did you forget about the video when you first came.
I hit that spot twice and since then.
You haven't been the same.
Now I heard you fucking with some new man.
Can't remember his name.
But my first impression: what a lame.
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane.
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with a shoulder stain.
Faggot.
Six months, and I'm still at it.
You probably never hear this track.
But I still rap it.
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here.
I swear I can't imagine you to not even care.
Whole thing played out like magic and it's kinda weird.
It's like I did a trick and you won't be reappear.
It ain't fair, I need you back sometimes I get scared.
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears.
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears.
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears.
'Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears.
'Cause I'm a player.
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes.
So I had to make the song cry cry.
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes.
So I gotta make the song cry.
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes.
So I had to make the song cry cry.
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes.
So I gotta make the song cry.
Yeah.
