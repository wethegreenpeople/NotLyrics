I'm about to lose my mind.
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor, call me a doctor.
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life.
.
I told the world one day, I would pay it back.
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back.
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that.
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday it's just so gray and black.
.
Hope, I just need a ray of that.
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em.
They just say it's whack, they don't know what dope is.
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this.
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest.
.
You picked me up, breathing life in me, I owe my life to you.
but for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do.
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son.
See this light in you, it's dark.
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you.
.
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue.
'Cause me and you were like a crew.
I was like your sidekick, you gon' either wanna fight me.
When I get off this fucking mic or you gon' hug me.
But I'm not an option, there's nothing else I can do 'cause.
.
I'm about to lose my mind.
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor, call me a doctor.
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life.
.
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas.
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled.
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy but you're either getting lazy.
Or you don't believe in you no more.
Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form.
.
Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself.
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help.
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor.
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are.
.
It was you who believed in me.
When everyone was telling you don't sign me.
Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth.
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you.
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre.
I'm crying in this booth.
.
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours.
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more.
But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me.
Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake.
.
I'm about to lose my mind.
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor, call me a doctor.
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life.
Bring me back to life, bring me back to life, bring me back to life.
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life.
.
It literally feels like a lifetime ago.
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though.
You walked in, yellow jumpsuit, whole room, cracked jokes.
But once you got inside the booth, told you like smoke.
.
Went through friends, some of them I put on.
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death.
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them.
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim.
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him.
.
Fucking backstabbers.
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us.
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots.
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?.
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots, and the cracker's ass.
.
Little crackerjack beat, making wack mass.
Backwards producers, I'm back bastards.
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving.
I'll guarantee they scream, Dre don't leave us like that man 'cause.
.
I'm about to lose my mind.
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time.
I need a doctor, call me a doctor.

Before I chrome the lot, can't keep it home a lot.
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock.
You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block.
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off.
How? My last album was "The Chronic".
They want to know if he still got it.
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it.
.
If you ain't up on pace.
.
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game.
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats.
Still not loving police (Uh huh).
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho').
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (fo life).
Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang.
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still.

Since the last time you heard from me I lost a friend.
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again.
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem.
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week.
Still, I stay close to the heat.
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet.
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat.
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep.
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat.
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat.
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop.
It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru.
I'm still at it, After-mathematic.
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics.
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic.
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E.

Laid back in the shack, play this track.
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world.
(Still hitting them corners in them low low's girl).

Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back.
.
So if you ain't up on thangs.
.
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game.
Still got it wrapped like a mummy.
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money.

Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars.
Still gon' get mine regardless.

The Chronic 2001.
Forget About Dre (featuring Eminem).
[Dr Dre].
Ya'll know me still the same ol' G.
But I been low key.
Hated on by most these niggas.
Wit no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys.
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's.
Mad at me cause.
I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries.
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks.
To add to the wall full of plaques.
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies.
But ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze.
Ho Please.
You better bow down on both knees.
Who you think taught you to smoke trees.
Who you think brought you the o' G's.
Eazy-E's Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's.
And a group that said muthafuck the police.
Gave you a tape full of dope beats.
The bomb weed stroll through in you hood.
And when your album sales wasn't doin too good.
Who's the doc that he told you to go see.
Ya'll better listen up closely.
All you niggas that said that I turned pop.
Or the Firm flop.
ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep.
So fuck ya'll all of ya'll.
If ya'll don't like me blow me.
Ya'll are gonna keep fuckin around wit me.
And turn me back to the old me.
.
[chorus] x2 [Eminem].
.
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say.
But nothin comes out when they move they lips.
Just a buncha gibberish.
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre.
.
[Eminem].
So what do you say to somebody you hate.
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way.
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way.
Just study your tape of NWA..
One day I was walkin by.
Wit a walkmen on.
When I caught a guy givin me an awkward eye.
And strangled him off in the parkin lot wit his Karl Kani.
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not.
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge.
But I'm drunk as fuck.
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage.
Hoppin out wit two broken legs tryna walk it off.
Fuck you too bitch call the cops.
I'ma kill you and them loud ass muthafuckin barkin dogs.
And when the cops came through.
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house.
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches.
And still one found out.
From here on out it's the Chronic 2.
Startin today and tomorrows the new.
And I'm still loco and nuts.
To choke you to death wit a Charleston chew.
.
Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies.
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up.
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's.
Callin men ladies.
Sorry Doc but I been crazy.
There is no way that you can save me.
It's ok go with him Hailey.
.
[chorus] x2.
.
[Dr Dre].
If it was up to me.
You muthafuckas would stop comin up to me.
Wit your hands out lookin up to me.
Like you want somethin free.
When my last cd was out you wasn't bumpin me.
But now that I got this little company.
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease.
But you won't get a crumb from me.
Cause I'm from the streets of.
I told em all.
All them little gangstas.
Who you think helped mold 'em all.
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns.
Like I ain't got none.
What you think I sold 'em all.
Cause I stay well off.
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off.
What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad.
Tryna get this damn label off.
I ain't havin that.
This is the millenium of Aftermath.
It ain't gonna be nothin after that.
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap.
You can have it back.
So where's all the mad rappers at.
It's like a jungle in this habitat.
But all you savage cats.
Knew that I was strapped wit gats.
When you were cuddled wit cabbage patch.
.
[Chorus] x3Hi, baby, I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work.
And all, and I do understand.
You have no idea how much I understand.
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you.
I love you so much.
.
I think about you, I feel you in my arms.
I miss you, I miss you terribly.
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life.
I love you so much that I'd do anything.
I'd do anything, I'll be your perfect woman for you.
.
I just wanna fuck bad bitches.
All them nights I never had bitches.
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches.
Mad at 'cha boyfriend, ain't 'cha?.
You're a bad girl, gotta spank ya.
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic.
.
Explicit, hella photogenic.
And tell your friends where the dick's at.
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate.
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate.
She Swallowed It, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight.
.
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it.
And Hit the Man hit it, damn bitches.
Man, this is what I'm talkin' about.
Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth.
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place.

Don't need you all in mine, I just wanna fuck you.

Loves you, you need to give him your quality time.

You got the number, it's on you to make the call.
You know I cum quick, help you re-decorate your walls.
Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock.
And if I'm goin' too far, I take it out and wipe it off.
.
And  put it back up, and keep goin'.
You tryin' to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin'.
That your pussy's been tampered with.
Did you show him the new trick of.
How you can make it smoke a cancer stick.
.
You be workin' it like a dancer bitch, it's hard on me.
Not to give you all of my time, that you wanted.
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed.
I'd rather spend my mornin' diggin' through some records instead.
.
But, tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases.
Hookup somewhere and exchange some 'Fuck Faces'.
I know your man's lookin' for ya, he's always tryin' to run ya.
Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin' gul 'cause I just wanna fuck witchu.

Fuck witchu, on the sneak tip, on some creep shit.
So whatcha gon do, ya freak bitch?.
You, actin', like you, don't, do, dicks.

.
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said.
So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head.
I fucked her on the flo', so I wouldn't mess up my bed.
Then Lil' 1/2 Dead put his dick on her head.
.
Take that bitch home, and give her a bone.
And give her the number to my cellular phone.
Man, she blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major.
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her.
.

Ain't tryin' to stock around for the illuminati.
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G.

Since way back I've been collecting my fee.
With the 48-tracks and the M I C.
Got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea.
It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3.
.
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide.
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo.
It's how I ride, cartel style.
Full, stacked to the max now.
.
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how.
'Dre Day' every day trips to Montigo Bay.
With more chips than Frito Lay.
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly.
Straight or illegal, it's still the root of all evil, 'cause.

Young black Rockerfeller, hell, a swiss and Mozzarella.
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller.
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split.
So when you come across a fool get all that she be getting'.
.
Ladies, get your paper too.
Don't expect for no man to support you, keep it true.
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos.
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads.
.
I'mma keep buildin', make it killing.
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions.
That's where it's at you got drama, I got the gat.
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat.

Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get.

Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'.
Honeys start to stare.
'Cause game is money and money is game.

And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame.
Now many people die over these dead green guys.
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise.
It's the root of all evil and sins.
.
Yet and still it makes the world go around.
Like my 20-inch rims, moolah y'all.
Platinum plaques cover my walls.
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw.
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce.
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause.

I been there and done that.
Been there, done that, The AftermathY'all know me, still the same O.G but I been low key.
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese.
No deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys.
No books, no snowmobiles and no ski's.
.
Mad at me 'cause.
I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries.
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks.
To add to the wall full of plaques.
.
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies.
Did y'all think I'm let my dough freeze?.
Hoe please, you better bow down on both knees.
.
Who you think taught you to smoke trees.
Who you think brought you the oldies.
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's.
And the group that said mother, "Fuck the police".
.
Gave you a tape full of dope beats.
To bump when you stroll through in your hood.
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good.
Who's the doctor they told you to go, see.
.
Y'all better listen up closely.
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or the the Firm flopped.
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep.
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me.
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around with me.
And turn me back to the old me.

One day I was walkin' by with a Walkman on.
When I caught a guy givin' me an awkward eye.
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot with his Karl Kani.
.
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not.
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge.
When I'm drunk as fuck.
Right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage.
.
Hopin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off.
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops.
I'ma kill you too and them loud ass muthafuckin' barkin dogs.
.
And when them cops came through me.
And Dre stood next to a burnt down house.
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches.
And still weren't found out.
Right here.
.
From here on out it's the Chronic 2.
Startin' today, tomorrow's the new.
And I'm still loco enough.
To choke you to death with a Charleston chew.
.
Slim shady, hotter than a set of twin babies.
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up.
When the temp goes up to the mid 80's.

Callin' men ladies.
Sorry Doc but I been crazy.
There is no way that you can save me.
It's okay, go with them, Hailey.

Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease.
But you won't get a crumb from me.
'Cause I'm from the streets of.

Who you think helped mold 'em all.
Now you wanna run around, talking about guns.
Like I ain't got none.

What you think, I sold 'em all 'cause I stay well off.
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off.
What, 'cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad.
Tryna get this damn label off.

I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath.
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that.
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap.

You hear the bass from the trunk when I'm on the block.
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off.
How? My last album was "The Chronic".
They want to know if he still got it.
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it.

If you ain't up on thangs.

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game.
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats.
Still not loving police (Uh huh).
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho').
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (fo life).
Still the beat bangs, still doing my thang.
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still.

Still, I stay close to the heat.
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet.
My life is like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat.
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep.
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat.
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat.
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the troop.
It's "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru.
I'm still at it, After-mathematic.
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics.
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic.
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E.

We're comin', we're comin', we're comin'.
We're here.

From state-to-state we're touchin' home.
No matter what sign you throw up.
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slippin'.
Bringin' you all bangin' speakers for sparks fly out the car system.
.
Off the tops, snatchin' props and the proper the tops we touch.
We're hard to knock, we got it locked.
From every angle of music, the different sound view.
R&B;, Rap, whatever flavor, kid, it's all new.
So say we bring it with the East and the West.
.
The final results, the aftermath touchin' every coast.
So when the bar blows then the DJ spins.
And we don't set trip, we set trends.
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest.
If they business is tight.

'Cuz keep it real means moving the cash markets.
And constantly buildin' and stop destroying.
Everything that we touch.
And leave somethin' for our children.

Anybody killaThings just ain't the same for gangstas.
Times is changing, young niggas is agin'.
Becoming old gees in the game and changin'.
To make way for these new names and faces, but.
.
The strangest things can happen from rappin', when.
Niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'.
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic.
Zipped up in bags when it happens, that's it.
.
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go.
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow.
Watched 'em up high, and suddenly watched 'em grow.
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough.
.
Best friends and money, I lost them both.
Went, visited niggas in the hospital.
It's all the same shit all across the globe.
I just sit back and watch the show.
(The watcher).
.
Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before.
(The watcher).
People I used to know just don't know me no more.
(The watcher).
But everywhere that I go I got people I know.
(The watcher).
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low.
(I watch).
.
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?.
Niggas ain't made me if niggas they can't be.
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see.
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach.
.
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?.
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill.
And choose a new spot if niggas wanted you shot.
I ain't a thug, how much Tupac in you, you got.
.
I ain't no bitch neither, it's either my life or your life.
I ain't leaving, I like breathing.
Nigga we can go round for round.
Clip for clip, shit, for pound for pound.
.
Nigga if you really want to take it there we can.
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man.
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that.
When you wanna come and fill these shoes.

Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in.
.
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous.
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges.
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages.
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers.
.
But now we got a new era of gangstas.
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us.
Lookin' at us, now callin' us busters.
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us.
.
Nigga we started this gangsta shit.
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?.
It's funny how time fly.
I'm just havin' fun, just watchin' it fly by.
(The watcher).

Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before.
(The watcher).
People I used to know just don't know me no more.
(The watcher).
But everywhere that I go I got people I know.

Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low.

Miscellaneous.
Forgot About Dre (Video Version).
Dr. Dre:.
Y'all know me.
Still same ol' G.
But I've been low key.
Hated on by most these {niggas} with no cheese.
No deals and no keys.
No wheels and no G's.
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis.
Mad at me cuz I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries.
Got a crib full of studio when it's all full of tracks.
To add to the wall full of plaques.
Hangin up in the office in the back of my house like trophies.
But y'all think I'ma let my dog freeze.
{Ho} please.
You better bow down on both knees.
Who you think taught you to smoke {trees}?.
Who you think brought you the oldies?.
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C.'s and Snoop D.O. Double G's.
And the group that said {mother-Fuck} Tha Police.
Gave you a tape full of dope beats.
The bomb weed stroll through in your hood.
And when your album sales it wasn't doin to good.
Who's the doc that he told you to go see?.
Y'all better listen up closely.
All you {niggas} that said that I turned pop.
Or the firm flop.
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep.
So {fuck} y'all.
All y'all.
If y'all don't like me, {blow} me.
Y'all gon' keep {fucking} around with me.
And turn me back to the old me.
.
Chorus: (Eminem).
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say.
But nothing come out when they move their lips.
Just a buncha gibberish.
And {motherfuckers} act like they forgot about Dre (x2).
.
Eminem:.
So what do you say to somebody you hate?.
Or anyone tryna bring trouble in your way.
Wanna resolve things in a {bloodier} way?.
Just study your tape of N.W.A..
One day I was walking by with a walkman on.
When I caught a guy giving me an awkward eye.
Till I {strangled} him off in the parking lot.
With his Karl Kani.
I don't give a {fuck} if it's dark or not.
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge.
But I'm drunk as fuck.
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage.
.
*music stops*.
Old Woman:.
Well, I know you! You are ruining my sleep and my ??.
this is a shame. I say stop do that, it's embarrasing. You.
are messing up my....
.
Reporter:.

And this gentleman you seems to have upseeded all happen....

Eminem:.
Yeah, all I now is I'm upstairs,and i'm listenin to my Will Smith C.D..
And I see all thse flames going everywhere. You no what I'm sayin..
Hey, hold on a minute {bitch}! Yo... hold on a minute..
Detroit what! Detroit what! Detroit baby!.
Reporter:.
???, I'm Jane Yamamoto, back to the studio..
*music starts*.
.
Eminem:.
And when the cops came through me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house.
With a {can full of gas} and a {hand full of matches}.
And still no one found out (right here).
So from here on out it's the Cronic 2.
Starting today, and tomorrows the new.
But I'm still loco and nuts to choke you to {death} with a Charleston chew.
*chikichikichiki*.
Slim Shady.
Hotter than a set of twin babies.
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up.
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's.
Callin men ladies.
Sorry doc but I've been crazy.
There's no way that you can save me.
It's okay, go with him Hailie.
.
Chorus.
.
Dr. Dre:.
If it was up to me, you {muh'fuckas} would stop comin up to me.
With you hands out lookin up to me like it was something free.
When my last CD was out you weren't bumpin me.
But now that I got this little company.
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some desease.
But you won't get a crumb from me.
Cuz I'm from the streets of ({Fucking} Compton).
I told 'em all.
All them little gangsta's, who you think helped mold 'em all?.
Now you wanna run around, talk about {guns} like I ain't got none.
What, you think I sold 'em all?.
Cuz I stay well off.
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off.
What, cuz I've been in the lab.
With a pen and a pad.
Tryna get this damn label off.
I ain't havin that.
This is the millenium of aftermath.
It ain't gon' be nothing after that.
So give me one more platinum plaque and {fuck} rap.
You can have it back.
So where's all the Madd Rapper's at?.
It's like a jungle in it's habitat.
But all you savage cats knew that I was {strapped} with {gats}.
When you were cuddled with a cabbage patch.
.
Chorus (x1).
.
Dr Dre:.
Who's next?.

Hittman:.
Comin in something this hit from Bronson.
Echolaborating with Dre from Compton.
Huh, I can't say you little something.

Dre:.
Hittman 2000.
.
Hittman:.
Hittman at your service.

And work your body down.
(Yeah).
No time to funk around 'cause we gon'.

Funk you, right on up.
So get up, get a move on and get your groove on.
It's the D R E, the spectacular.
In a party, I go for your neck, so call me Blackula.
.
As I drain a niggaz jugular vein.
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain.
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill.
Keepin' it real enables me to make another meal.
.
Still niggaz run up and try to kill at will.
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil.
I wipe niggaz off the face of the earth since birth.
I been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth.
.
More than a Stealth Bomber, I cause drama.
The enforcer, music floats like a flyin' saucer.
Or a 747 jet, never forget.
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet.
.
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick.
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick.
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'.
The motherfuckin' D R E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'.
.
Keep their headz ringin.
(Ring ding dong ringa ding ding ding dong).
Keep their headz ringin.
(Ring ding dong ringa ding ding ding dong).
.
One, two for the crew, three, fo' for the dough.
Five for the hoe, six, seven, eight for Death Row.
(Hoe).
Mad niggaz about to feel the full effect of intellect.
So I can collect respect, plus a check.
.
Now I fin' to, get into to my mental.
Will take care of this business I need to attend to 'coz my rent's due.
And this rap shit's my meal ticket.
So you goddamn right I'm gonna kick it or get evicted.
.
I bring terror like Stephen King.
A black Casanova, runnin' niggaz over like Christine.
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got.
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut.
.
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong.
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong.
When I flow, niggaz know, it's time to take a hike.
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke.
.
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted.
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted.
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'.
The motherfuckin' D R E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'.
.
Keep their headz ringin.
(Ring ding dong ringa ding ding ding dong).
Keep their headz ringin.

Yeah, c'mon.
If you want to get on down.
Yeah, c'mon.
You gotta get on down.
It's like that.
Just get on down.
.
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear.
Without a care, runnin' shit as if I was a mayor.
But I ain't no politician, no competition.
Sendin' all opposition to see a mortician.
.
I'm up front, never in the back drop.
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top.
Your rhyme sounds like you bought 'em at Stop-N-Go.
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop N' Glow.
.
Many tried to but just can't rock with.
I'm 6 1, 225, a pure chocolate.
Your chances of jackin' me are slim, G.
'Cause I rock from summer 'til Santa comes down the chimney.
.
Ho, ho, ho and so as I continue to flow.
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly Negro.
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'.
The motherfuckin' D R E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'.

Keep their headz ringin.
(Ring ding dong ringa ding ding ding dong).
Keep their headz ringin.

For the 1 9 9 to the nickel.

Artist: group therapy (b-real, krs-one, nas, rbx).
East coast *killer*, west coast *killer* (repeat 8x).
.
Verse one: rbx.
.
While childish mc's battle over coastal fronts.
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts.
If you want to be evil like knieval then jump.
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump.
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental.
Custom designed, for instrumental.
Yes indeedy, lyrical graffiti.
And this one's a burner, baby.
Truck, like toyata driven.
True and livin drivin with the gat.
Uhh, pop the clutch, let the cold crush rush.
Then i flush wack material.
That's if i don't mash them all to mush.
Hush, let me burst, dare i gush.
Cock-diezel cuts.
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic.

East coast *killer*, west coast *killer* (repeat 4x).

Verse two: krs-one.
.
Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin they career?.
Before i bust your shit let's get one thing clear.
Don't provoke kris no joke this.
I don't ride no rapper's nutsac yo i stay focused.
Beefin without skills seekin will only weaken.
The artist speakin over beats and, you be cheatin.
Cacaphony of small talent rappers, claimin a coast.
Over instrumentals, ain't got no real street credentials.
Here come the philosopher hip-hopppin ya correctly.
Ignorant ass mc's continue to tempt me.
Lyrics be empty like alcatraz cellblock.
Too many mc's rappin causin lyrical gridlock.
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox.
Yet i'm still unknown like the x on sadat.
Just your typical, non-topical.
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be usin.
I check one-two's and who's in the house.
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth.
Whattyou think this is? krs-one from the bronx kid!.
.
East coast *killer*, west coast *killer* (repeat 8x).

Welcome to the new world order.
You are now under martial law.
All constituional rights have been suspended.

Verse three: b-real.

The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this.
Coast trippin goin on through out the business.
East coast west coast anybody killer!.
I don't give a fuck where you from i'ma killa hill-er.
I got crews on both sides together.
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever.
Fool i can roll through any block.
From central to westland avenue, without my glock.
But some niggaz can't survive on both sides.
So they try and break off, eliminate ties.
Fools got to get wise, better realize.
True, enemy lies killin in the highrise.
Office, analyzing the song.
Look at them red niggaz, don't even get along.
Kill that noise, four niggaz bringin the skill.
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the hill.
.
Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty group therapy.
The mighty mighty aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know.
You're not ready to rumble or test this.
Kill that noise!.

East coast *killer*, west coast *killer (repeat 8x).

Verse four: nas escobar.
.
Now when i bomb like sadaam, the world feels the wrath of khan.
Desert storm in this modern day babylon.
I be the twelve disciples strap arms.
All black on running your spot hit the safe and i'm gone.
Like a thief wrong, i keep the long 38 warm.
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on.
Focus on your rap holsters, notice.
I'm evil like the exorcist to the locusts.
Ferocious thoughts, are mergin at night.
Like jehovah towards the virgin in white.
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite.
Like a israelite snatchin hoes up, my flow's up.
When the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up.
It's a holdup, frontin like you down for the real.
To make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal.
Like heavy heel, but what's the fuckin deal?.

When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh.
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass.

One feed me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash.
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass.
Came home uptight, ready to mash, like a gas pedal.

Jeans hot as pepper so I sip, champagne on stormy shores.
