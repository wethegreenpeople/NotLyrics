At This Point In My Life.
Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right.
Oh I, Oh I've.
Done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right.
At this point in my life.
I've done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right.
If you put your trust in me I hope I won't let you down.
If you give me a chance I'll try.
You see it's been a hard road the road I'm traveling on.
And if I take your hand I might lead you down the path to ruin.
I've had a hard life I'm just saying it so you'll understand.
That right now, right now, I'm doing the best I can.
.
At this point in my life.
At this point in my life.
Although I've mostly walked in the shadows.
I'm still searching for the light.
Won't you put your faith in me.
We both know that's what matters.
If you give me a chance I'll try.
You see I've been climbing stairs but mostly stumbling down.
I've been reaching high always losing ground.
You see I've been reaching high but always losing ground.
You see I've conquered hills but I still have mountains to climb.
And right now right now I'm doing the best I can.
At this point in my life.
.
Before we take a step.
Before we walk down that path.
Before I make any promises.
Before you have regrets.
Before we talk commitment.
Let me tell you of my past.
All I've seen and all I've done.
The things I'd like to forget.
.
At this point in my life.
At this point in my life.
I'd like to live as if only love mattered.
As if redemption was in sight.
As if the search to live honestly.
Is all that anyone needs.
No matter if you find it.
.
You see when I've touched the sky.
The earth's gravity has pulled me down.
But now I've reconciled that in this world.
Birds and angels get the wings to fly.
If you can believe in this heart of mine.
If you can give it a try.
Then I'll reach inside and find and give you.
All the sweetness that I have.

Smoke And Ashes.
.
.
.
I'd heard rumors and I'd heard talk.
About the trail you'd left of broken hearts.
About the sea of tears too wide to cross.
But a little bad press has never scared me off.
So I burned a path to figure out.
How to get me some of what you got.
.
I've got a red hot heart.
If the talk is true your's is the same.
And we should be together.
And let our passions fan love's flame.
.
When I looked for you I almost passed you by.
You were so cool and calm I thought my friends had lied.
But I thought so much reserve must make you wild inside.
It was there and then that I knew I had to get some of what you got.
.
I've got a red hot heart.
If the talk is true your's is the same.
And we should be together.
And let our passions fan love's flame.
.
I thought I'd won your heart when I held you hand in mine.
I thought it was true love the way we complemented each other.
But my right is your wrong.
And when you're right then I'm left with nothing.
Your light and your heat have all been spent.
Leaving only smoke and ashes.
Only smoke and ashes baby.
.
I've got a red hot heart.
Any your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins.
I say there's fire down below.
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby.
.
I'm crying all the time.
Salty stinging tears.
And mourning for the past carbon-dated years.
But knowing now for certain that you were always right.
Because if a breeze could blow you out of my life.
It's only smoke and ashes baby.
Only smoke and ashes baby.
.
I've got a red hot heart.
And your heart's as blue as the blood in your veins.
I say there's fire down below.
You say it's only smoke and ashes baby.
.
I was blinded by devotion.
My unwavering love for you.
So blinded that I thought all your lies were true.
But now I know for certain since you've gone away.
It was just a smoldering fire I mistook for a blaze.
Only smoke and ashes baby.

I thought thought that I could find a way.
To beat the system.
To make a deal and have no debts to pay.

But all that you have is your soul.

Here I am waiting for a better day.

Behind The Wall.
Last night I heard the screaming.
Loud voices behind the wall.
Another sleepless night for me.
It won't do no good to call.
The police.
Always come late.
If they come at all.
.
And when they arrive.
They say they can't interfere.
With domestic affairs.
Between a man and his wife.
And as they walk out the door.
The tears well up in her eyes.
.
Last night I heard the screaming.
Then a silence that chilled my soul.
I prayed that I was dreaming.
When I saw the ambulance in the road.

And the policeman said.

Will the crowd disperse.
I think we all clould use some sleep"Tracy Chapman.

Leaving me at a loss.

But with feelings this strong.

Subcity.

Off the waste and decay.

We can't receive any government relief.
I'd like to please give Mr. President my honest regards.

.
And the only one who could ever reach me.
Was the son of a preacher man.
The only boy who could ever teach me.
Was the son of a preacher man.
Yes, he was, he was, oh, yes, he was.

He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man.
I guessed he was the son of a preacher man.
Sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man.

Be Careful Of My Heart.
.
.
.
You and your sweet smile.
You and your tantalizing ways.
You and your honey lips.
You and all the sweet things that they say.
You and your wild wild ways.
One day you just up and walked away.
.
You left me hurting.
But I can forgive you for that now.
You taught me something.
Something took half my life to learn.
When you give all yourself away.
Just tell them to be careful of your heart.
.
.
Be careful of my heart, heart.
Be careful of this heart of mine.
Be careful of my heart, heart.
It just might break and send some splinters flying.
Be careful of my heart, heart.
Be careful.

You you you.
You you you.
You you you.
Took my love.
Thought you took it all.
.
.
You you you.
You you you.
You you you.
Took my love.
And now you're gone.
.
But I'm not breaking down.
And I'm not falling apart.
I just lost a little faith.
When you broke my heart.
Given a chance.
I might try it again.
But I wouldn't risk it all this time.
.
.
I'd save.
A little love for myself.
Enough for my heart to mend.
A little love for myself.
One day I just might love again.
One day some sweet smile might turn my head.
One day I just might give all myself away.
One day.
One day.
One dayTracy Chapman.

Words don't come easily.

Maybe if I told you the right words.
At the right time you'd be mine.

I love you.

Talking' Bout A Revolution.
TALKIN' BOUT A REVOLUTION.
Tracy Chapman.
.
Don't you know.
They're talkin' bout a revolution.
It sounds like a whisper.
Don't you know.
They're talkin' about a revolution.
It sounds like a whisper.
.
While they're standing in the welfare lines.
Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation.
Wasting time in the unemployment lines.
Sitting around waiting for a promotion.
.
Poor people gonna rise up.
And get their share.
Poor people gonna rise up.
And take what's theirs.
.
Don't you know.
You better run, run, run....
Oh I said you better.
Run, run, run....

Finally the tables are starting to turn.
Talkin' bout a revolution.

You can close your eyes.
And see a picture perfect life.
Inside of your mind.
Dreaming only of the days ahead.
Wanted and wished for more than now.
Or the days behind.
You waste your time.
.
The picture makes a promise.
The flesh lets it be broken.
The picture makes a promise.
The flesh lets it be broken.
.
You can never think.
You can't even stop yourself.
Before the words have been spoken.
And you've already said.
You would give everything.
And something for nothing.
Everybody thinks you're joking.
.
The picture makes a promise.
The flesh lets it be broken.
The picture makes a promise.
The flesh lets it be broken.
.
You want to be the one.
Made over be your own.
Before and after.
And a supermarket.
Beauty in a bottle queen.
Who'll one day grace a check-out counter.
Magazine front cover.
Though the fine print reads.

The picture makes a promise.
The flesh lets it be broken.

Lets it be broken.

Lets it be broken.
Lets it be broken.
Lets it be broken.
Broken.
Broken.
.
When your life is never what you wanted.
Not even halfway normal.
Just tarnished and soiled.
When in your reach.
A framed and frozen moment.
So far from perfection.
Not truth or transcendence.
Will set you free.
Still you don't believe.

All you folks think you own my life.
But you never made any sacrifice.
Demons they are on my trail.
I'm standing at the crossroads of the hell.
I look to the left I look to the right.
There're hands that grab me on every side.
.
.
All you folks think I got my price.
At which I'll sell all that is mine.
You think money rules when all else fails.
Go sell your soul and keep your shell.
I'm trying to protect what I keep inside.
All the reasons why I live my life.

Some say the devil be a mystical thing.
I say the devil he a walking man.
He a fool he a liar conjurer and a thief.
He try to tell you what you want.
Try to tell you what you need.
.
.
Standing at the point.
The road it cross you down.
What is at your back.
Which way do you turn.
Who will come to find you first.
Your devils or your gods.

All you folks think you run my life.
Say I should be willing to comprimise.
I say all you demons go back to hell.
I'll save my soul save myself.
