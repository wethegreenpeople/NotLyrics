A MAN AND A WOMAN.
.
When hearts are passing in the night, in the lonely night.
then they must hold each other tight, oh, so very tight.
and take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light.
they'll stay together so much in love..
.
And in the silence of the night, of the morning mist.
when lips are waiting to be kissed, longing to be kissed.
where is the reason to resist and deny a kiss.
that holds a promise of happiness?.
.
Tho' yesterday still surrounds you.
with a warm and precious memory.
maybe for tomorrow.
we can build a new dream for you and me..
.
This glow we feel is something rare, something really rare.
so come and say you want to share, want to really share.
the beauty waiting for us there, calling for us there.
that only loving can give the heart..
.
When life is passing in the night, in the rushing night.
a man, a woman in the night, in the lonely night.
must take a chance that in the light, in tomorrow's light.
they'll be together so much in love,.
together so much in love..
.
So tell me you're not afraid to take a chance, really take a chance,.
let your heart begin to dance, let it sing and dance.
to the music of a glance, of a fleeting glance,.
to the music of romance, of a new romance..
Take a chance, take a chance..
.
