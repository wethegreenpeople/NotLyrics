nahah nahah.
Now.
.
I can feel the animal inside.
My resolve is weakening.
Pounding on the doors of my mind.
It's nearly overpowering.
.
I cannot begin to describe.
The hunger that I feel again.
Run if you intend to survive.
For the beast is coming to life.
.
Taking form in the glimmer.
Of this tainted moonlight.
Death approaches on this night.
.
For the animal's soul is mine.
We will be completed right before your eyes.
I have no control this time.
And now we both shall dine in hell tonight.
.
I can feel the calling again.
The primal need is filling me.
Changes are about to begin.
And now my blood is boiling.
.
I can see the fear in your eyes.
But you can't bring yourself to scream.
Time to shed the mortal disguise.
For the beast is coming to life.
.
Taking form in the glimmer.
Of this tainted moonlight.
Death approaches on this night.
.
For the animal's soul is mine.
We will be completed right before your eyes.
I have no control this time.
And now we both shall dine in hell tonight.
.
We begin the hunt tonight.
'Til the power courses, the creatures take flight.
When the kill is close and I will be satisfied.
.
For the smell of fear tonight.
Wakes an ancient lust that will not be denied.
You're mine.
.
For the animal's soul is mine.
We will be completed right before your eyes.
I have no control this time.
And now we both shall dine in hell tonight.
.
For the animal's soul is mine.
And the world around will never hear your cries.
An unholy crime.
And now we both shall dine in hell tonight.
.
nahah nahahCan you feel that?.
.
Drowning deep in my sea of loathing.
Broken your servant I kneel.
Will you give it to me?.
It seems what's left of my human side.
Is slowly changing in me.
Will you give it to me?.
.
Looking at my own reflection.
When suddenly it changes, violently it changes.
Well, I know, there is no turning back now.
You've woken up the demon in me.

Don't try to deny what you feel.
Will you give it to me?.
It seems that all that was good has died.
And is decaying in me.
Will you give it to me?.
.
It seems you're having some trouble.
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes.
Now the world is a scary place.
Now that you've woken up the demon in me.

As I learn to hide the agony.
To make a final remedy.

With the way you tried to completely refuse all your life.
Feed on your nothing, you'll never live up to me.
.
Awaken you with a little evil inside.
Feed on your nothing, you'll never live up to me.
I've stricken you, I don't wanna live with the lie.
Feed on your nothing and you'll never live up to me, yeah.
Awaken you, you know can't live up to me, sure.
I've stricken you, ooh can't live up to me.
.
There isn't a thing that I can do.
Watching this whole thing just wash away.
Making me long.
There isn't a thing that I can do.
Watching this whole thing just wash away.
Making me long, making you strong.

A little somethin' for your ear hole, get up.
Baring a part of my soul again, get up.
Disturbed in the house, we're droppin' plates.
.
You said it couldn't be done.
Told me that it's the kind of battle that just couldn't be won.
You know you're too sick, too hard, too fucked in the head.
You'll never make it, no, not in this lifetime.
.
Well guess again my friend, don't act surprised.
We got the bass drum kick that will blow out your eyes.
'Cause when you hear this shit, you'll get to steppin'.
Gonna fight the war and use my music as a weapon.
.
You know I'm talkin' 'bout recognition.
You know I'm talkin' 'bout vindication.
.
Another goddamn slap in the face.
Don't wanna give us a place, are you afraid?.
.
Well fear this 'cause I'm breakin'.
Through the walls of your nightmare.
Wake up time to die, the way I'm livin' there.
Is no compromising it.
.
Better get ready for another surprise.
And it may leave a mark because I'm coming fast.
Plantin' thoughts in your mind.
And droppin' plates on your ass.
.
Well, here I come, I'm droppin' plates on your ass.
Well here I come, I'm droppin' plates on your ass bitch.
You never mind and you don't need this.
Well here I come, I'm droppin' plates on your ass bitch.
You never mind and you don't need.

Well on your mark, here we go again.
Well, never mind 'cause you're not number one.
You're too hard and from the other side.
I think it's time to bring it home again right to meStill enough, although I know you're not begging.
Still as the thoughts running through your mind.
Still enough, although I know you're not begging.
Give me a reason to make you mine.
.
I will devour you, take all the pain away.
I cannot stay my hand.
From reaching out so that I can.
.
Empower you for all eternity.
It seems to ease my mind.
To know that you've brought meaning to my life.
.
Had enough, although I see you're not running.
Still are the thoughts running through your mind.
Dead to love, the path that you are now taking.
Show me the reason to make you mine.

I cannot stay my hand.
From reaching out so that I can.

Empower you for all eternity.
It seems to ease my mind.
To know that you've brought meaning to my life.
.
Run to where the smallest ray of light will never find you.
Run to where you will not need to shield your eyes.
Run away from all the soulless heartless things to hound you.
Run away and let your memories go blind.
.
When I devour you, take all the pain away.
I cannot stay my hand.
From reaching out so that I can.
.
Empower you for all eternity.

Realized that I'm nothing I wanted to be.
I can never change anything I've done.
Because it's the only thing I have left.
.
Blame myself again for what I didn't do.
Never really knew it was coming from me.
Change the way I felt the worst is yet to come.
Because I have gone too far now.
.
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody.
Change my mind.
And it leads me to a new disease.
.
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody.
Let it die.
But it still becomes a new disease.
.
Today.
.
Is this all worth what this has done to me.
Water down my senses and turn them on me, fuck morality.
And everything I know if I didn't hate this then I couldn't go.
Impersonate myself for what I used to be, denial is all that's left now.

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody.

Let the flame of my heart, burn away.
Your complacence tonight.
I command you to rise.
Wash away the decay of your life.
Feel the light of your eyes.
Find the way through the darkness tonight.
Fearing no one.

Do you really think I covet like you do?.

Pure emotion falling from my eyes.
You are vindicating, liberating.
Saviors of my soul.
.
Now rise, throw away the charade of your life.
Let the flame of my heart, burn away.
Your complacence tonight.
Fearing no oneI'm without fault today, didn't think it would kill you.
To settle the debt I thought never would be paid.
Found out I was wrong today, too weak to continue.
One final defense to fall, still I'm broken.
.
Now I am torn, thought it was over this time.
And we know there's still a fire inside.
And we know and we know.
We're gonna let it burn, let it burn.
Till the image fades away.
.
Knew there was a price to pay, didn't think it would thrill you.
To witness the fallen ones shattered and ashamed.
No, I'm not the only one with a need to fulfill you.
One willing to risk it all, still uncertain.
.
Now I am torn, thought it was over this time.
And we know there's still a fire inside.
And we know and we know.
We're gonna let it burn, let it burn.
Till the image fades away, yeah.

As I fight to uncover your sacred lie.
And the fear isn't going away.
As the soldiers still die.
.
Let your followers know that their lives have been sold.
For the good of your sacred lie.
For the truth to be told and the pain to unfold.
We must start asking why.
.
Don't you know the war is far from over now.
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now.
As our brothers die defending no one.
The war is far from over now.
.
Liberation, a moral charade.
When the cause is a part of your sacred lie.
Damnation a moment away.
In all the world's eyes.
.
It's the doom of us all.
We give in to control for the sake of your sacred lie.
Complications abound.
You'll get used to the sound of alarms in your life.
.
Don't you know the war is far from over now.
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now.
As our brothers die defending no one.
The war is far from over now.

Give us a moment of peace in our lifetime.
A moment of peace in our lifetime.
Give us a moment of peace in our lifetime.

A moment of peace right now.

O W A A A A, O W A A A A.
Aw aw, aw aw, aw aw.
.
Drowning deep in my sea of loathing broken, your servant, I kneel.
(Will you give in to me?).
It seems what's left of my human side is slowly changing in me.
(Will you give in to me?).
.
Looking at my own reflection.
When suddenly it changes, violently it changes.
Oh, no there is no turning back now.
You've woken up the demon in me.
.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Open up your hate and let it flow into me.
.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
You motha get up, come on get down with the sickness.
You fucka get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Madness is the gift that has been given to me.
.
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising.
Don't try to deny what you feel.
(Will you give in to me?).
It seems that all that was good has died and is decaying in me.
(Will you give in to me?).
.
It seems you're having some trouble.
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes.
Oh, no, the world is a scary place.
Now that you've woken up the demon in me.
.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Open up your hate and let it flow into me.
.
Get up, come on get down with the sickness.
You motha get up, come on get down with the sickness.
You fucka get up, come on get down with the sickness.
Madness is the gift that has been given to me.

No mommy don't do it again, don't do it again.
I'll be a good boy, I'll be a good boy, I promise.
No mommy don't hit me.
Ow, why did you have to hit me like that mommy?.
.
Don't do it you're hurting me o-how.
Why do you have to be such a bitch?.
Why don't you? Why don't you fuck off and die?.
Why can't you just fuck off and die?.
Why can't you just leave here and die?.
.
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch.
Fuck you, I don't need this shit.
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore.
Would you like to see how it feels mommy?.
Here it comes get ready to die.

Madness has now come over meNo one knows just what has become of her.
Shattered doll, desperate.
Oh, so innocent and delicate.
But too damn obdurate.
And obstinate to let go.
.
Broken down, hurt again, it never ends.
Frightened and trembling.
Did she fall again? An accident.
Her eyes encircled in black again.
I can't believe that she's still with him.
.
For how long will you try?.
How long until you walk away?.
Your facade can't disguise.
The fact that you're in misery.
.
Look inside, see what has become of her.
Hiding within again.
Can she pick herself up again?.
It's just too difficult and arduous to let go.
.
Homicide flashes through her mind again.
No more pain, take control.
If he raises his hand again.
She'll find her freedom in killing him.
The world will see that she's had enough.
.
For how long will you try?.
How long until you walk away?.
Your facade can't disguise.
The fact that you're in misery.
.
For how long will you try?.
How long until you walk away?.
From the look in your eyes.
I know you bleed internally.
.
For how long will you deny?.
How long until you walk away?.
Your facade can't disguise.
The fact that you're in misery.
.
For how long will you try?.
How long until you walk away?.
From the look in your eyes.
I know you bleed internally.
.
Broken down, hurt again.
It never ends.
