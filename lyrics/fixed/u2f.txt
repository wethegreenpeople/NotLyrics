See the stone set in your eyes.
See the thorn twist in your side.
I wait for you.
.
Sleight of hand and twist of fate.
On a bed of nails she makes me wait.
And I wait without you.
.
With or without you.
With or without you.
.
Through the storm we reach the shore.
You give it all but I want more.
And I'm waiting for you.
.
With or without you.
With or without you.
I can't live, with or without you.
.
And you give yourself away.
And you give yourself away.
And you give, and you give.

My hands are tied.
My body bruised, she got me with.
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose.

I was on the outside when you said.
You said you needed me.
I was looking at myself, I was blind, I could not see.

A boy tries hard to be a man.
His mother takes him by his hand.
If he stops to think he starts to cry, oh why.

Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap.
Spent the night trying to make a deadline.
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline.
.
I have your face here in an old Polaroid.
Tidying the children's clothes and toys.
You're smiling back at me, I took the photo from the fridge.
Can't remember what then we did.
.
I haven't been with a woman, it feels like for years.
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears.
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose.
The scent of it lingers and then it just goes.
.
Return the call to home.
.
The worst of us are a long drawn out confession.
The best of us are geniuses of compression.
You say you're not going to leave the truth alone.
I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home.
.
Child drinking dirty water from the river bank.
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank.
I'm waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come.
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon.
.
Return the call to home.
.
Now I've got a head like a lit cigarette.
Unholy clouds reflecting in a minaret.
You're so high above me, higher than everyone.
Where are you in the Cedars of Lebanon?.
.
Choose your enemies carefully 'cause they will define you.
Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you.
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends.
Gonna last with you longer than your friendsJohnny take a walk with your sister the moon.
Let her pale light in to fill up your room.
You've been living underground, eating from a can.
You've been running away from what you don't understand.
Love.
.
She's slippy.
You're sliding down.
She'll be there.
When you hit the ground.
.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
She moves in mysterious ways.
.
Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain.
Let her talk about the things you can't explain.
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal.
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel.
On your knees boy.
.
She's the wave.
She turns the tide.
[Incomprehensible].
She knows why.
.
It's all right, it's all right, all right.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's all right, it's all right, all right.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's all right, it's all right, all right.
Lift my days, light up my nights, love.
.
One day you will look back.
And you'll see where you were held how.
By this love while you could stand there.
You could move on this moment, follow this feeling.
.
It's all right, it's all right, all right.
She moves in mysterious ways.
It's all right, it's all right, all right.

Oh love, oh love.

Move you, spirit move, move.
Move you, move with it.
She moves with it.
Lift my days, light up my nights, loveThe future needs a big kiss.
Winds blows with a twist.
Never seen a moon like this.
Can you see it too?.

Night is falling everywhere.
Rockets at the fun fair.
Satan loves a bomb scare.
But won't scare you.
.
Hey! Sexy boots.
Get on your boots, yeah.

You free me from the dark dream.
Candy floss ice cream.
All our kids are screaming.
But the ghosts aren't real.

Laughter is eternity.
If joy is real.

You say, one love, one life.
When it's one need in the night.
One love, we get to share it.
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.
.
Did I disappoint you?.
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?.
You act like you never had love.
And you want me to go without.
.
Well it's too late tonight.
To drag the past out into the light.
We're one but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other.
One!.
.
Have you come here for forgiveness?.
Have you come to raise the dead?.
Have you come here to play Jesus?.
To the lepers in your head.
.
Did I ask too much? More than a lot.
You gave me nothin' now it's all I got.
We're one but we're not the same.
Well we hurt each other then we do it again.

You say love is a temple, love a higher law.
Love is a temple, love the higher law.
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl.
And I can't be holdin' on to what you got.
When all you got is hurt.

One love, one blood.
One life, you got to do what you should.
One life, with each other.
Sisters, brothers.

One life but we're not the same.
We get to carry each other, carry each other.
One.
OneThe heart is a bloom.
Shoots up through the stony ground.
There's no room.
No space to rent in this town.
.
You're out of luck.
And the reason that you had to care.
The traffic is stuck.
And you're not movin' anywhere.
.
You thought you'd found a friend.
To take you out of this place.
Someone you could lend, a hand.
In return for grace.
.
It's a beautiful day.
Sky falls, you feel like.
It's a beautiful day.
Don't let it get away.
.
You're on the road.
But you've got no destination.
You're in the mud.
In the maze of her imagination.
.
You love this town.
Even if that doesn't ring true.
You've been all over.
And it's been all over you.
.
It's a beautiful day.
Don't let it get away.
It's a beautiful day.
.
Touch me.
Take me to that other place.
Teach me and.
I know I'm not a hopeless case.
.
See the world in green and blue.
See China right in front of you.
See the canyons broken by cloud.
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out.
See the Bedouin fires of night.
See the oil fields at first light and.
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth.
After the flood all the colours came out.
.
It was a beautiful day.
Don't let it get away.
Beautiful day.
.
Touch me.
Take me to that other place.
Reach me.
I know I'm not a hopeless case.

What you don't have you don't need it now.
What you don't know you can feel it somehow.
What you don't have you don't need it now.
Don't need it now.
.
It's a beautiful dayI'm not afraid of anything in this world.
There's nothing you can throw at me.
That I haven't already heard.
I'm just trying to find a decent melody.
A song that I can sing in my own company.
.
I never thought you were a fool.
But darling, look at you, ohh.
You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight.
These tears are going nowhere, baby.
.
You've got to get yourself together.
You've got stuck in a moment.
And now you can't get out of it.
Don't say that later will be better.
Now you're stuck in a moment.
And you can't get out of it.
.
I will not forsake, the colors that you bring.
But the nights you filled with fireworks.
They left you with nothing.
I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me.
I listen through your ears and through your eyes I can see.
.
And you are such a fool.
To worry like you do, ohh.
I know it's tough and you can never get enough.
Of what you don't really need now, my oh my.
.
You've got to get yourself together.
You've got stuck in a moment.
And you can't get out of it.
Oh love, look at you now.
You've got yourself stuck in a moment.
And now you can't get out of it.
.
I was unconscious, half asleep.
The water is warm till you discover how deep.
I wasn't jumping for me it was a fall.
It's a long way down to nothing at all.
.
You've got to get yourself together.
You've got stuck in a moment.
And you can't get out of it.
Don't say that later will be better.
Now you're stuck in a moment.
And you can't get out of it.

And if the night runs over.
And if the day won't last.
And if our way should falter.
Along the stony pass.
.
And if the night runs over.
And if the day won't last.
And if your way should falter.
Along the stony pass.
It's just a moment.
This time will passNobody else here, baby.
No one here to blame.
No one to point the finger.
It's just you and me and the rain.
.
Nobody made you do it.
No one put words in your mouth.
Nobody here takin' orders.
When love took a train heading south.
.
It's the blind.
Leading the blond.
It's the stuff.
It's the stuff of country songs.
.
Hey, if God will send his angels.
And if God will send a sign.
And if God will send his angels.
Would everything be alright?.
.
God has got his phone off the hook, babe.
Would He even pick up if He could?.
It's been a while since we saw that child.
Hanging 'round this neighborhood.
.
You see his mother dealing in a doorway.
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl.
And Jesus sister's eyes are a blister.
The high street never looked so low.
.
It's the blind.
Leading the blond.
It's the cops.
Collecting for the cons.
.
So where is the hope.
And where is the faith and the love?.
What's that you say to me.
Does love light up your Christmas tree?.
.
The next minute.
You're blowing a fuse.
And the Cartoon Network.
Turns into the news.
.
If God will send his angels.
And if God will send a sign.
Well, if God will send his angels.
Where do we go? Where do we go?.
.
Jesus never let me down.
You know Jesus used to show me the score.
Then they put Jesus in show business.
Now it's hard to get in the door.
.
It's the stuff.
It's the stuff of country songs.
But I guess.
It was something to go on.
.
If God will send his angels.
Sure could use them here right now.
Well, if God would send his angels.
.
And I might not want my life.
And I want my lover feel my soul.
(So where do we go?).
And I want my love and I.
And I want to feel alone.
(So where do we go?).
How?I like to smile but I like to mostly stay with you.
I like good times but I can't feel this without you.
By my song the heart is in the place.
I sing this song, probably so.
.
If I could sigh, I'd tell the world I'd felt with you.
I like the time, I like the feeling when.
I feel you in my arms, I'll take you in my hand.
I'll let you go, somebody save me, somebody save me.
.
Sing it, sing my, sing my song.
We sing the same old song loud.
.
Smile though your heart breaks in two.
Touch me when will I be with you.
I like good times but I can feel it's going wrong.
You sing the same old song now I think it's time to get it right.
.
Sing it out, sing out.
Sing this same old song.
.
If I could swim, I'd swim in circles.
If I could drown, I'd, I'd drown with you.
If I had enough of my life.
I can't tell if I had enough of youI wanna trip inside your head.
Spend the day there.
To hear the things you haven't said.
And see what you might see.
.
I wanna hear you when you call.
Do you feel anything at all?.
I want to see your thoughts take shape.
And walk right out.
.
Freedom has a scent.
Like the top of a new born baby's head.
The songs are in your eyes.
I see them when you smile.
I've seen enough I'm not giving up.
On a miracle drug.
.
Of science and the human heart.
There is no limit.
There is no failure here sweetheart.
Just when you quit.
.
I am you and you are mine.
Love makes no sense of space.
And time will disappear.
Love and logic keep us clear.
Reason is on our side, love.
.
The songs are in your eyes.
I see them when you smile.
I've had enough of romantic love.
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up.
For a miracle, a miracle drug.
A miracle drug.
.
God I need your help tonight.
.
Beneath the noise, below the din.
I hear your voice it's whispering.
In science and in medicine.
I was a stranger you took me in.
.
The songs are in your eyes.
I see them when you smile.
I've had enough of romantic love.
Yeah, I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up.
For a miracle, miracle drug.
Miracle, miracle drugI'm 'round the corner from anything that's real.
I'm across the road from hope.
I'm under a bridge in a rip tide.
That's taken everything I call my own.
.
One step closer to knowing.
One step closer to knowing.
.
I'm on an island in a busy intersection.
I can't go forward, I can't turn back.
Can't see the future, it's getting away from me.
I just watch the tail lights glowing.
.
One step closer to knowing.
One step closer to knowing.
One step closer to knowing.
Knowing, knowing.
.
I'm hanging out to dry with my old clothes.
Finger still red with the prick of an old rose.
Well the heart that hurts is a heart that beats.
Can you hear the drummer slowing?.

One step closer to knowing.
One step closer to knowing.
One step closer to knowing.
To knowing.

Two shots of happy, one shot of sad..
You think I'm no good, well I know I've been bad..
Took you to a place, now you can't get back..
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad..

Walked together down a dead-end street.
We were mixing the bitter with the sweet..
Don't try to figure out what we might have had..
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad..

I'm just a singer, some say a sinner.
Rolling the dice, not always a winner..
You say I've been lucky, well hell, I made my own.
Not part of the crowd not feeling alone..

Under pressure but not bent out of shape.
Surrounded, we always found an escape..

Drove me to drink but hey, that's not all bad..

Greedy with my children, my lovers and my wife..
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad..

Both never to come back.

Like a newborn baby.
It just happens everyday.

I look inside myself.
See my heart is black.
I see my red door.

Maybe then I'll fade away.
Not have to face the facts.
It's not easy facing up.
When your whole world is black.

No more will my green sea.
Will turn a deeper blue.
I could not foresee.
This thing happening to you.

Until you're able to toy, broken toy.
Shout, shout, you're inside out.
.
If you don't know electric co.
If you don't know electric co.
.
Red, running red play for real.
The toy could feel a hole in your head.
You go in shock, you're spoon fed.
.
If you don't know electric co.
If you don't know electric co.
.
One, two, three, four.
I can't [Incomprehensible].
[Incomprehensible].
.
If you don't know electric co.
If you don't know electric co.
If you don't know electric co.
If you don't know electric co.
If you don't know electric co.
If you don't know electric co.
.
[Incomprehensible].
Just to hear me.
[Incomprehensible].
I've found me way home.
[Incomprehensible]Sunshine, sunshine.
Sunshine, sunshine.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
.
I was lost between the midnight and the dawning.
In a place of no consequence or company.
3:33 when the numbers fell off the clock face.
Speed dialing with no signal at all.
.
Go, shout it out, rise up, oh, oh.
Escape yourself and gravity.
Hear me, cease to speak that I may speak.
Shush now, oh, oh.
Force quit and move to trash.
.
I was right there at the top of the bottom.
On the edge of the known universe where I wanted to be.
I had driven to the scene of the accident.
And I sat there waiting for me.
.
Restart and reboot yourself.
You're free to go, oh, oh.
Shout for joy if you get the chance.
Password, you enter here right now.
.
Oh, oh, you know your name so punch it in.
Hear me, cease to speak that I may speak.
Shush now, oh, oh.
Don't move or say a thingTell me the perfect color.
Show me the ways and numbers.
Don't give it away.
What's the certainty?.
.
There's a known complication.
I don't want to know.
Where does it go nobody knows.
Nobody knows, nobody knows.
.
There's a long conversation.
Hitting deep within your bosom.
And you've held onto nothing.
For way too long.
.
There are words long unspoken.
And a heart which hasn't broken.
But the time keeps on growing on and on.
On and on, on and on.
.
See what you need.
Then you'll see there's no other way to be.
Take your time, don't be shy.
It's your time to shine.
.
Tell me the perfect color.
Show me the ways and numbers.
Tell me the thoughts you think of.
Show me the constellation.
.
Don't give it away.
Don't give it away.
Don't give it away.
Don't give it awayOh my love, it's a long way we've come.
From the freckled hills, to the steel and glass canyons.
From the stony fields, to hanging steel from the sky.
From digging in our pockets for a reason not to say goodbye.
.
These are the hands that built America.
(Russian, Sioux, Dutch, Hindu).
Oh America.
(Polish, Irish, German, Italian).
.
Last saw your face in a watercolor sky.
As sea birds argue, a long goodbye.
I took your kiss, on the spray of the new land star.
You gotta live with your dreams, don't make them so hard.
.
And these are the hands, that built America.
(The Irish, the blacks, the Chinese, the Jews).
Ah America.
(Korean, Hispanic, Muslim, Indian).
.
Of all of the promises, is this one we could keep.
Of all of the dreams, is this one still out of reach.
.
Halle, ole.
(Dream, dream, oh love).
.
It's early fall, there's a cloud on the New York skyline.
Innocence, dragged across a yellow line.
.
These are the hands that built America.
These are the hands that built America.
Ah America, ah AmericaWhere I came from there were no hills at all.
The land was flat, the highway straight and wide.
My brother and I would drive for hours.
Like we had years instead of days.
Our faces as pale as the dirty snow.
.
Once I knew there was a love divine.
Then came a time I thought it knew me not.
Who can forgive forgiveness where forgiveness is not.
Only the lamb as white as snow.
.
And the water, it was icy as it washed over me.
And the moon shine above me.
.
Now this dry ground, it bears no fruit at all.
Only poppies laugh under the crescent moon.
The road refuses strangers, the land, the seeds we sow.
Where might we find the lamb as white as snow.
.
As boys we would go hunting in the woods.
To sleep the night shooting out the stars.
Now the wolves are every passing stranger.
Every face we cannot know.
If only a heart could be as white as snow.
If only a heart could be as white as snow.
