Eminem and Dilated Peoples Freestyle.
*after shoutouts and talking*.
.
[Eminem].
Peace to Thirstin Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth.
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth.
I'm just a nerd cursed, wit badly disturbed nerves.
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?.
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth.
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin wit your turf.
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch.
Wit smeard letters, runnin together in blurred spurts.
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts.
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts.
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's.
My first words were "Bleep bleep" and "Curse curse".
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt.
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs.
Yankin out my stitches, hollering "Nurse nurse!".
"You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse!".
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church.
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps.
And it's like that, and it's like that.
.
[Evidence].
Got no apathy.
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy.
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony.
Between you and I, I'll tell you here's the diff.
Gun to your head, you're dead, pointblank I shapeshift.
That's right, to dear/deer, anelope, or owl.
In life, use your potential, or Steve Howe.
I'm about to call it quits, yo too much weight'll break your rack mount.
The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout.
You say I use my name too much as a clutch.
Try holdin on to beat instead of pushin on your crutch.
Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head.
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you comin.
Deaf/Def like Leppards, pop the piece, I be the sheppard.
Causin the herd, the name is Ev absurd.
Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that.
Methaphor imagery, you claimin metaphors and spittin similies.
Not havin It, the name is Evidence.
Like Pos. K gibbin the life thinkin of stabbin it.
Skills prevail you possess, take no offense.
But don't profess lies within your mind, tempt and stress.
.
[Iriscience].
It's like uh-oh-oh.
It's Dilated Peoples on the Wake Up Show-uh-oh.
We kick a lick or some for the radio-uh-oh.
Yo CaTashTrophic like Rico *fades out*I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts.
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon.
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over.
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em, quickest damn gun slinger I've ever seen.
Got murdered in cold blood, that ol' saloon there was their lil' home.
Away from home, they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live.
In that tavern and on a quiet night, you can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine.
.
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet.
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat.
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph.
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head.
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed.
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead.
Told him each one of his boys is dead.
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said.
.
Who hard? yo I done heard worse.
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other.
To see which one'll swerve first.
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds.
That of a globe on top of nine other planets.
Kissed the cheek of the devil, intelligence level is hellier than.
Treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto.
.
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist.
Intercepting missiles wit my bare hands like a patriot.
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse.
In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse.
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations.
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth.
.
'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil.
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people.
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal.
Above the law 'cuz I don't agree wit police either.
We ain't eager to be legal.
So please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle.
.
I breathe ether in three amounts.
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle.
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range.
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain.
He's insane, no I'm not, I just want to shoot up.
And I'm pissed off 'cuz I can't find a decent vain.
.
The disaster wit dreads.
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough.
To kill my soul after I'm dead.
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter.
'Cuz I serve any stranger with money.
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains.
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches.
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral.
.
Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you.
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows crackin' jaws.
Wit my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass.
I'm blazin' MC's, at the same time amazin' MC's.
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin' to me.
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough.
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt.
.
Hello? Billy, aiyyo what's up.
We're comin' to get you.
Stop, they know it's us.
.
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?.
I'm the one who burned your house down.
Well I'm out now, and this time.
I'm comin' back to blow your house up.
And I ain't gone leave you a window to jump out of.
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms.
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms.
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave.
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe.
.
'Cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil.
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people.
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal.
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel.
We'll be waitin', See you in hell.
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady.
See you in hell for the sequel, bye bye.
Bad meets evil, what? Till next time.
.
{And so that's the story when bad meets evil.
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county.
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens.
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did.
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon.
But their spirits still live on till this day.
Wait, did y'all hear that?}Lately I've been hard to reach.
I've been too long on my own.
Everybody has their private world.
Where they can be alone.
.
Are you calling me?.
Are you trying to get through?.
Are you reaching out for me?.
I'm reaching out for you.
.
I'm just so fucking depressed.
I just can't seem to get out this slump.
If I could just get over this hump.
But I need something to pull me out this dump.
.
I took my bruises, took my lumps.
Fell down and I got right back up.
But I need that spark to get psyched back up.
And in order for me to pick the mic back up.
.
I don't know how or why or when.
I ended up this position I'm in.
I'm starting to feel dissin' again.
So I decided just to pick this pen.
.
Up and try to make an attempt to vent.
But I just can't admit.
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap.
I need a new outlet.
.
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow.
But I can't just sit back and wallow.
In my own sorrow but I know one fact.
I'll be one tough act to follow.
.
One tough act to follow.
I'll be one tough act to follow.
Here today, gone tomorrow.
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles.
.
In my shoes, just to see.
What it's like, to be me.
I'll be you, let's trade shoes.
Just to see what it'd be like.
.
To feel your pain, you feel mine.
Go inside each others' minds.
Just to see what we'd find.
Look at shit through each others' eyes.
.
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful.
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you.
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful.
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you.
.
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor.
Everything's so tense and gloom.
I almost feel like I gotta check.
The temperature of the room.
.
Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me.
And so I try to avoid any eye contact.
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door.
For conversation, like I want that.
.
I'm not looking for extra attention.
I just wanna be just like you.
Blend in with the rest of the room.
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom.
.
I don't need no fucking man servant.
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass.
Laugh at every single joke I crack.
And half of 'em ain't even funny like.
.
Ha! Marshall you're so funny man.
You should be a comedian, god damn!".
Unfortunately I am.
I just hide behind the tears of a clown.
.
So why don't you all sit down.
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell.
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes.
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles.
.
In my shoes, just to see.
What it's like, to be me.
I'll be you, let's trade shoes.
Just to see what it'd be like.
.
To feel your pain, you feel mine.
Go inside each others minds.
Just to see what we'd find.
Look at shit through each others eyes.
.
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful.
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you.
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful.
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you.
.
Nobody asked for life to deal us.
With these bullshit hands we're dealt.
We gotta take these cards ourselves.
And flip 'em, don't expect no help.
.
Now I could've either just sat on my ass.
And pissed and moaned.
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in.
And get up and get my own.
.
I was never the type of kid.
To wait by the door and pack his bags.
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed.
For a dad to show up who never did.
.
I just wanted to fit in.
Every single place, every school I went.
I dreamed of being that cool kid.
Even if it meant acting stupid.
.
And Edna always told me.
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that.
Meanwhile I'm just standing there.
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that.
.
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole.
At 8 years old.
I learned my lesson then.
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more.
.
But I already told you my whole life story.
Not just based on my description.
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin.
It's probably 110% different.
.
I guess we would have to walk a mile.
In each others shoes at least.
What size you wear? I wear 10's.
Let's see if you can fit your feet.
.
In my shoes, just to see.
What it's like, to be me.
I'll be you, let's trade shoes.
Just to see what it'd be like.
.
To feel your pain, you feel mine.
Go inside each others minds.
Just to see what we'd find.
Look at shit through each others eyes.
.
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful.
They can all get fucked just stay true to you.
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful.
They can all get fucked just stay true to you.
.
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful.
They can all get fucked just stay true to you.
So.
.
Lately I've been hard to reach.
I've been too long on my own.
Everybody has their private world.
Where they can be alone.
.
Are you calling me?.
Are you trying to get through?.
Are you reaching out for me?.
I'm reaching out for you.
.
Yeah, to my babies.
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon.
.
And to the rest of the world.
God gave you shoes to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny.
Don't ever let anyone tell you you ain't beautifulEminem.

I'm constantly copin' over you.
Squattin', shit has gotten to the point.

This is chicken scratch, shit is sickenin'.
I've been kickin' ass off bullshit.
Throwaway rhymes, pick a batch.
I live for the love of rap, you crazy.
Ive made beats for Jay-Z for free.
Page me, you need a beat, you Cannabis.
Then it's Dre's fee, you Kay Slay the fees waved.
I stay beefin' with JD, till the day Dre 2-ways me.

Drama King, Kay Slay, mothafucka, We dictate these mixtapes mothafucka.
Xzibit blaze little gay midget cocksuckaMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?.
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it'd all be gray.
But your picture on my wall.
It reminds me that it's not so bad.
It's not so bad.

It reminds me that it's not so bad.
It's not so bad.
.
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'.
I left my cell, my pager.
And my home phone at the bottom.
I sent two letters back in autumn.
You must not have got 'em.
It probably was a problem.
At the post office or somethin'.
.
Sometimes I scribble addresses.
Too sloppy when I jot 'em.
But anyways fuck it.
What's been up man, how's your daughter?.
My girlfriend's pregnant too.
I'm out to be a father.
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?.
I'm a name her Bonnie.
.
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry.
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch.
Who didn't want him.
I know you probably hear this everyday.
But I'm your biggest fan.
I even got the underground shit that you did with scam.
.
I got a room full of your posters.
And your pictures man.
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too.
That shit was fat.
Anyways I hope you get this, man.
Hit me back just to chat.
Truly yours, your biggest fan.
This is Stan.
.
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?.
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it'd all be gray.
But your picture on my wall.
It reminds me that it's not so bad.
It's not so bad.
.
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote.
I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad.
I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans.
If you didn't want to talk to me.
Outside the concert you didn't have to.
But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew.
That's my little brother man.
.
He's only 6 years old.
We waited in the blistering cold for you.
For 4 hours and you just said "No".
That's pretty shitty man.
You're like his fuckin' idol.
He wants to be just like you man.
He likes you more than I do.
.
I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to.
Remember when we met in Denver.
You said if I write to you, you would write back.
See I'm just like you in a way.
I never knew my father neither.
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.
.
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs.
So when I have a shitty day.
I drift away and put 'em on.
Cause I don't really got shit else.
So that shit helps when I'm depressed.
I even got a tattoo.
With your name across the chest.
.
Sometimes I even cut myself.
To see how much it bleeds?.
It's like Adrenaline.
The pain is such a sudden rush for me.
See everything you say is real.
And I respect you 'cause you tell it.
My girlfriend's jealous.
'Cause I talk about you 24/7.
.
But she don't know you like.
I know you Slim, no one does.
She don't know what it was like?.
For people like us growing up.
You've gotta call me man.
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose.
Sincerely yours, Stan.
P.S. We should be together too.
.
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?.
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it'd all be gray.
But your picture on my wall.
It reminds me that it's not so bad.
It's not so bad.
.
Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans.
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass.
It's been six months and still no word.
I don't deserve it?.
I know you got my last two letters.
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect.
.
So this is my cassette I'm sending you.
I hope you hear it.
I'm in the car right now.
I'm doing 90 on the freeway.
Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka.
Ya dare me to drive?.
.
You know this song by Phil Collins.
'From the air in the night'.
About that guy who could have saved.
That other guy from drowning?.
But didn't, then Phil saw it all.
Then at his show he found him.
.
That's kinda how this is.
You could have rescued me from drowning.
Now it's too late.
I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy.
.
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call.
I hope you know.
I ripped all  your pictures off the wall.
I loved you Slim, we could have been together.
Think about it, you ruined it now.
.
I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep.
And you scream about it.
I hope your conscious eats at you.
And you can't breathe without me.
.
See Slim, "Shut up bitch!.
I'm trying to talk".
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk.
But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up.
See I ain't like you.
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more.
And then she'll die too.
.
Well gotta go.
I'm almost at the bridge now.
Oh shit! I forgot!.
How am I supposed to send this shit out?.
.
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?.
Got out of bed at all.
The morning rain clouds up my window.
And I can't see at all.
And even if I could it'd all be gray.
But your picture on my wall.
It reminds me that it's not so bad.
It's not so bad.
.
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner.
But I've just been busy.
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now.
How far along is she?.
Look I'm really flattered.
You would call your daughter that.
And here's an autograph for your brother.
I wrote it on your starter cap.
.
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show.
I must have missed you.
Don't think I did that shit intentionally.
Just to diss you.
And what's this shit you said about.
You like to cut your wrist too?.
I say that shit just clownin' dawg.
C'mon, how fucked up is you?.
.
You got some issues Stan.
I think you need some counselin''.
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls.
When you get down some.
And what's this shit about us.
Meant to be together?.
That type of shit'll make me not want us.
To meet each other.
.
I really think you and your girlfriend.
Need each other.
Or maybe you just need to treat her better.
I hope you get to read this letter.
I just hope it reaches you in time.
Before you hurt yourself.
I think that you'll be doin' just fine.
If you'd relax a little.
.
I'm glad I inspire you.
But Stan, why are you so mad?.
Try to understand.
That I do want you as a fan.
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit.
I seen this one shit on the news.
A couple weeks ago that made me sick.
.
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge.
And had his girlfriend in the trunk.
And she was pregnant with his kid.
And in the car they found a tape.
But it didn't say who it was to?.
Come to think about it.
His name was, it was you! Damn!Yeah, I know sometimes.
Things may not always make sense to you right now.
But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier.
Stiffen up that upper lip, what you cryin' about? You got me.
.
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad.
When I'm gone but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had.
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh.
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry.
.
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers.
No more cryin', wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares.
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney.
Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it.
.
We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls.
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls.
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you.
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news.
.
I try to keep up sheltered from it but somehow it seems.
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me.
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see.
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did.
.
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me.
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever.
Bein' together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers.
But then of course everything always happens for a reason.
.
I guess it was never meant to be but it's just somethin'.
That we have no control over and that's what destiny is.
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep.
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream.
.
Now hush little baby, don't you cry.
Everything's gonna be alright.
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya.
Daddy's here to hold you through the night.
.
I know mommy's not here right now.
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside.
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby.
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright.
.
Heh, it's funny, I remember back one year.
When daddy had no money.
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up.
And stuck 'em under the tree.
.
And said some of 'em were from me.
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em.
I'll never forget that Christmas.
I sat up the whole night cryin'.
.
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job.
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom.
And at the time, every house that we lived in.
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block.
.
And your mom, was savin' money for you in a jar.
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college.
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it.
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart.
.
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart.
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back.
On the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment.
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara.
.
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD.
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me.
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me.
Then you started seein' daddy on the TV.
.
And momma didn't like it and you and Laney were too young.
To understand that papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit.
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it.
I'm just sorry, you were there and had to witness it first hand.
.
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud.
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin', lookin'.
At your baby pictures, it just trips me out to see how much.

Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya.
Daddy's here to hold you through the night.

I know mommy's not here right now.
And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside.
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby.
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright.
.
And if you ask me to.
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird, I'ma give you the world.
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you.
I'll do anything for you to see you smile.
.
And if that mockingbird don't sing.
And that ring don't shine, I'ma break that birdie's neck.
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya.
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad, ha haI'll be.

Fuck is wrong with youWho came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough.
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl.
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl.
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world.
.
So come and kill me while my name's hot.
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot.
Think I've got a generation brainwashed.
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot.
.
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot.
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch.
Purple haze and acid raindrops.
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop.

Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top.
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop.
Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you.
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you.

.
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful.
I like birds, bees, I like people.
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful.
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool.
.
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike.
While I blow my brain out, took a see what it feels like.
And this is how I am in real life.
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice.
.
How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat.
When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet.
So bring the money by tonight.
'Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife she ever saw in her life.
.
I try to keep it positive and play it cool.
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school.
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better.
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a 'Fuck you' letter.

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets.
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free.
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a mini thin, Slim Shady.
I'm Shady.
.
Yo, I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it.
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit.
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it.
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit.
.
But they love it when you make your business public.
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we're on the subject.
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it.
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it.
.
I do take pills, don't do speed.
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed.
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms.
Do drink beer, I just wanna make a few things clear.
.
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitchin'.
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'.
It's not syphilis, and as for bein' AIDS infested.
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested.

We're gonna have a problem here.
.
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before.
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door.
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before.
They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture.
It's the return of the, "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding.
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?".
And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots.
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!.
Feminist women love Eminem.
Chigga chigga chigga, "Slim shady, I'm sick of him.
.
Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what.
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!".
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose.
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms.
Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't.
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose.
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips.
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss".
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids.
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is.
.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is.
By the time they hit fourth grade.
They got the discovery channel don't they?.
"We ain't nothing but mammals", well, some of us cannibals.
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes.
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope.
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes.
.
I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady.
All you other slim shadys are just imitating.
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up.
Please stand up, please stand up?.

Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?.
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?".
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?.
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs.
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst.
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
.
You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V.
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!".
I should download her audio on MP3.
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me.
So I have been sent here to destroy you.
And there's a million of us just like me.
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me.
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me.
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me.

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you.
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room.
The only difference is I got the balls to say it.
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all.
I just get on the mic and spit it.
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it.
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can.
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums.
.
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty.
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting.
Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens.
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working.
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'.
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings.
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!".
With his windows down and his system up.
.
So, will the real shady please stand up?.
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?.
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control.
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?.

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady.
All you other slim shadys are just imitating.
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up.

I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt.
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer.
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer.
.
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue.
Witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch.
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on.
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn.
.
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits.
A premature birth that was four minutes late.
Mother are you there? I love you.
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel.
.
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed.
A main vein' with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?.
I take a breather and sighed, either I'm high, or I'm nuts.
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I.
.
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass.
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her.
'Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with.
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it.
.
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID.
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me.
I've been with 10 women who got HIV.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me.
.
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee.
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me.
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree.
You probably wanna grow up to be just like meSome days I just wanna up and call it quits.
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks.
Every time I go to get up I just fall in piss.
My life's like one great big ball of shit.
If I could just, put it all into all I spit.
Instead of always tryin to swallow it.
Instead of starin at this wall and shit.
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit.
Can't call it, shit.
.
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall.
If I have to see another one of mom's alcholic fits.
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it.
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic.
I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up.
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up.
Blow this buildin up, I've been sealed enough.
My cup, runneth over, I done filled it up.
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts.
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts?.
Well I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush.
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch.
Peal the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up.
Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up.
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be.
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me.
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see.
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see.
.
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee.
Out this world, ain't no one out there mind as me.
You need piece of mind? Here's a piece of mine.
All I need's a line.
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme.
To express how I'm really feelin at that time.
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes.
It's just sometimes, it's always me.
How dark can these hallways be?.
The clock strikes midnight, one-two, then half past three.
.
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper.
I'm desperate at my desk.
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again.
Stuck in this slum, can't think of nothin.
Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin.
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out.
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out.
I'm fizzlin now, thought I figured it out.
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out.
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?.
Why am I a slave to this trade?.
Signed out of spit to the grave.
Real enough to rill you up.
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want.
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter.
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a.
Fuckin boilin point, put some oil in your joints.
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed.
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense.
They hate me, see me and shake like a chainlink fence.
By the looks of 'em, you would swear their jaws was comin.
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin someone.
By the way they're runnin, you would swear the law was comin.
It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin.
Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back.
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest.
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock.
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch.
Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race.
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch.
I found my nitch, you gon' hear my voice.
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice.
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung.
If I had half a chance I'd grab it - Rabbit, runI take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers.
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills.
I've been to mushroom mountain once or twice but who's countin'.
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills.
.
Cool, calm, just like my mom.
With a couple of valium inside her palm.
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve.
Crawl up on you like Christopher Reeves.
.
I can't describe the vibe I get.
When I drive by 6 people and 5 I hit, ah shit.
I started a mosh pit, squashed a bitch.
And stomped the foster kids.
.
These shrooms make me hallucinate.
Then I sweat till I start losing weight.
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'.
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again.
.
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce.
I said c'mon bounce.
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce.
Not weed, I meant coke, dumbass, sit down.
.
We don't bullshit, better ask around.
D12 throws the bomb to gas your town.
Bizarre, your mom is passing out.
Get her ass on the couch before she passes out.
.
Fuck that, someone help Denaun.
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn.
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?.
It gotta be acid 'cos the X is gone.
.
Yeah, I took 'em all down with some parmesian.
And I think my arm is gone, it's probably numb.
Young, dumb and fulla cum.
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue.
.
You scary ass it was false alarm.
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?.
So stop acting stupid, you so high.
That you might wake up with a guy.
.
On some new shit, I think I did too much.
This substance equals cuffs.
Red pills, blue pills and green big pills.
(That's ill).
Mescaline.

Dirty Dozen, 80 of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us.
That's why our baby mothers.
Love us but they hate each other.
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other.
Some, something, something, something.
Something, something, something, something, I dunno.
.
Pop pills, pills I pop, pop two pills on stilts I walk.
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk.
Thought I was incredible and killed the hulk.
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade.
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days.
And when I'm old and gray.
.
Look for coke to smoke, no oki dok.
I pack up my nose with coke.
Am I supposed to choke?.
Had an accident when the Trojan broke.
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady.
Now I gotta straight born infant.
(You're crazy).
.
I pop four E's at one time.
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine.
You got any shrooms?.
Does Bizarre smoke crack?.
We can't get jobs 'cos our arms show tracks.
.
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?.
I do it just to get your company hijacked.
If you like smack then I might too.
(Swift, chill).
I just wanna get high like you.
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue.

Speed, shrooms, down the valium.
Even smoke weed outta vacuums.

High off chronic, gin and tonic demonic.
Body smelt like vomit.
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope headed guy.
Heroine mescaline, pencil legs wanna try?.

Blue pills, golden seals.
Got Bizarre actin' ill, drugs kill.

My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed.
Till one night he snuck in and said.
"We're goin' out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed".
.
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?".
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head.
Bust a nut, get some rest", the next day my mother said.
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid".
.
"The bastard won't even eat nothin', he's fed.
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead".
"Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset.
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck".
.
"I bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I'll bet.
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get.
I'll go handle this of course unless you object?".
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head".

Under my bed and up under my faucet.

Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot.

Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop.
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong.
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong.
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong.

Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn.
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on.
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off.
Everything 'cept his tank top and his trainin' bra.

Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady Dog.

Eminem Part 1.
Met a retarted kid named Greg, with a wooden leg.
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg.
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty.
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44-D.
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead.
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead.
No more said case closed end of discussion.
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion.
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas.
Cross the bombest.
We blowing up your house.
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas.
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus.
Cause I ain't making no more threats.
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes.
On Vietnam war vets.
I am more or less sick in the head.
Maybe more.
Because I smoked crack today, yesterday,.
and the day before Sabateur.
Walk the block with a labrador.
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador.
Foul style galore.
Verbal cow manure.
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure(*Prod. by Eminem).

K-ahm! Hhhh...Ayo, before I start this song man.
I just want to thank everybody for being so patient.
And baring with me over these last couple of years.
While I figure this shit out.
.
Is anybody out there?.
It feels like I'm talkin' 2 myself.
No one seems to know my struggle.
And everything I come from.
.
Can anybody hear me?.
It guess I keep talkin' 2 myself.
It feels like I'm going insane.
Am I the one whose crazy?.
.
Yeah.
Woah, woah, woah.
Woah, woah, woah.
.
So why in the world do I feel so alone?.
Nobody but me, I'm on my own.
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?.
If there is then let me in so I know that I'm not the only one.
.
I went away I guess to open up some lanes.
But there was no one who even knew.
What I was going through growing pains.
Hatred was flowing through my veins.
On the verge of going insane.
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne.
.
It's like I was jealous of him cause the attention he was gettin'.
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't.
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it.
Almost went at Kanye too.
.
God it feels like I'm goin' psychotic.
Thank god that I didn't do it.
I would of had my ass handed to me.
And I knew it but Proof wasn't here to see me through it.
I'm in the booth poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it.
.
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissin' people for no reason?.
Especially when you can't even write a decent punchline even.
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying.
Your health is declining with your self esteem, you're crying out for help.

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow.
All I know is I'm wallowin' self loathing and hollow.
Bottoms up of pill bottle maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow.
.
But I must be talkin' to the wall though.
I don't see nobody else.
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself).
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know.
I've turned into a hater I've put up a false bravado.
But Marshall is not a egomaniac, that's not his motto.
.
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, it's startin' to bottle.
Inside 'em, one foot on the brake one on the throttle.
Fallin' asleep with writers block in the parking lot of Mc Donalds.
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it.
.
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded you pouted long enough.
It isn't them it's you you fuckin', baby.
Quit worrying about what they do and do fuckin' Shady.
I'm fucking going crazy.

Hit my bottom so hard I bounce twice suffice this time around.
It's different them last two albums didn't count.
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out.
I've come up to make it up to you no more fucking around.
I've got something to prove to fans I feel like I let em down.

So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal.
I feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you.
For those of you who don't know.
The new mes back to the old me and homie I don't show no.
Signs of slowin' up, pullin' up, blowin' up, all over no mo.
My life is no longer a movie but the shows aint over homos.
.
I'm back with a vengeance homie Weezy keep ya head up.
TI keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up.
Don't let up, just keep slayin' 'em.

Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings.
Like whatever they say has no bearin'.
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearin'.
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'.
Alone in his own zone cold and he don't care.
He's a problem child what bothers him all comes out.
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out.
'Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out.
But if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out.
His thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin' back.
Talkin' black brainwashed from rock and rap.
He sags his pants two rags and a stockin' cap.
His step father hit him so he socked him back.
And broke his nose this house is a broken home.
There's no control he just lets his emotions go.
(C'mon).

Entertainment is danger intertwine it with gangsters.
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum.
Only you're unholy only have one homey.
Only this gun lonely 'cuz don't anyone know me.
But everybody just feels like they can relate.
I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great.
Or they can be great or even worse they can teach hate.
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make.
Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum.
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?.
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'.
To havin' a fortune no more kissin' ass.
But then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you.
Fans turn on you attorney's all gonna turn it to.
To get their hands on every dime you have.
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad.
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon.
You need to spew don't hesitate to produce air guns.
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me.
Swiftly just to get me off these streets quickly.
But all their kids been listen to me religiously.
So I'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me.
They're for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me.
If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, Pete.
It's all political if my music is literal and I'm a criminal.
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?.
I couldn't I wouldn't be fit to.
You're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you.

They say music can alter moods and talk to you.
But can it load a gun for you and cock it too?.
Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude.
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued.
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols.
And they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's cool.
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves.
We're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our sales.
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self.
We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail.
It's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'.
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted.
It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing.
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine.
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long.
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs.
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives.
So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they die.
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe.
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes.
That's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it.
Squeeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes golden.
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone.
Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs.
And we can.
