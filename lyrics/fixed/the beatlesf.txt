There are places I remember.
All my life, though some have changed.
Some forever not for better.
Some have gone and some remain.
.
All these places had their moments.
With lovers and friends, I still can recall.
Some are dead and some are living.
In my life I've loved them all.
.
But of all these friends and lovers.
There is no one compares with you.
And these memories lose their meaning.
When I think of love as something new.
.
Though I know I'll never lose affection.
For people and things that went before.
I know I'll often stop and think about them.
In my life I love you more.

About the space between us all.
And the people who hide themselves.
Behind a wall of illusion.
Never glimpse the truth.
Then it's far too late.
When they pass away.
.
We were talking.
About the love we all could share.
When we find it.
To try our best to hold it there.
With our love, with our love.
We could save the world.
If they only knew.
.
Try to realize it's all within yourself.
No one else can make you change.
And to see you're really only very small.
And life flows on within you and without you.
.
We were talking.
About the love that's gone so cold.
And the people who gain the world.
And lose their soul.
They don't know, they can't see.
Are you one of them.
.
When you've seen beyond yourself.
Then you may find.
Peace of mind is waiting there.
And the time will come.
When you see we're all one.
And life flows on within you and without youThe Beatles.

Brian Matthew: Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?.
Paul: We don't think so, really..
Brian: You don't ever think that?.
Paul: Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbing about you, which you get often..
John: Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids..
Brian: Now, what do you, eh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?.
John: No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see..
Brian: Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh--".
Paul: Like riding a bus?.
Brian: Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--.
Paul: Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things..
John: We go to certain ones..
George: And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us..
Paul: Joe's Café!.
Brian: Yeah, that figures..
Paul: Joe's Café! Social statement, that, you know..

With a little help from my friendsYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
