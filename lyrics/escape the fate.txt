Oh, I hate to be the one to bear the bad news
Yes, it is true
I finally fell in love
I fell so hard that I'm killing myself
Yes, I need out
Out of this grave that I've dug

And all the friends that I have gone through
And how much I deserve the pain
It's a shame

So hold your head
Hold it up high
Here's to the friends that were alibis
Keep this close by your side
When I come home we will have our night

Oh, they always told me I was gorgeous in a way
And that fateful day
I found who I was
So fill this hole with my prescriptions
I just keep feeding my addictions

And all the friends that I have gone through
And how much I deserve the pain
It's a shame

So hold your head
Hold it up high
Here's to the friends that were alibis
Keep this close by your side
When I come home we will have our night
We will have our night

You were the ones that stood by my side, whoa
And I was the one that fought all of your fights
Go!

(Hold your head, hold it up high) Whoa
(Keep this close by your side) Whoa

So hold your head
Hold it high
Here's to the friends that were alibis
Keep this close by your side
When I come home we will have our night

Hold your head
Hold it up high
Here's to the friends that were alibis
Keep this close by your side
When I come home we will have our night

Hold your head
Hold it up high
Here's to the friends that were alibis
Keep this close by your side
When I come home we will have our night
We will have our nightTrying to tear me apart,
Breaking me down to the bone
So listen closely,
'Cause what you don’t see
Is there’s still blood inside this beating heart

Still beating,
Still breathing
Falling from grace,
You laugh in my face
But you are the one who will leave with the beating

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that’s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound

Rising again from the fire,
A Phoenix alive and inspired
You can’t erase me, won’t even phase me
No one hears a fucking word you say

Still beating,
Still breathing
Falling from grace,
You laugh in my face
But you are the one who will leave with the beating

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that’s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound
With bleeding hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound

Stand and scream 
Stand and scream
Stand and scream
Stand and scream

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that’s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound
With bleeding hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound

With bleeding hands, these bleeding hands,
We stand up and scream while the rest of the world won't make a sound 
(stand and scream, stand and scream, stand and scream, stand and scream)A withered past and a blurry future,
My heart's on an auction,
It goes out to the highest bid.
I live to fast, and I know I will lose her,
But there is an option,
to die is to live in her head.
So I'll hang on, never let go.
I dug this pain into my chest.
It's dead.

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first.
Now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose,
So let me tell you the truth.

A deadly wish but it should've come sooner,
A corpse in a funeral that I would never attend.
There is a light on in the back of this house,
But you're not around,
To die is to live in her head.
So I'll hang on, never let go.
I dug this pain into my chest.
it's dead

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first.
Now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose,
So let me tell you the truth.

So, this goes out to the ones that fall in love.
And to the girl that filled my dark.

Last night I had the weirdest dream,
That you and I drove off the darkest streets,
Passing through these city lights,
Closure for the kids that died.

One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first.
Now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose,
So let me tell you the truth.
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first.
Now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose,
So let me tell you the truth.

So, this goes out to the ones that fall in love.
And to the girl that filled my dark.[Verse 1:]
This is the death of me*
I feel it constantly
Just like an enemy
That wants to see me bleed
So I try to be silent, but my words, they explode like hand grenades
I just gotta stay calm, before I let this time bomb blow up in my face

[Chorus 1:]
These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose

[Verse 2:]
The hounds have helped me cry
That's how they give to me
Inject my head with lies, the pain's astonishing
Like a flick or a stone, slowing crushing my bones, sending me to my grave
And if such a fate this life that I am going insane

[Chorus 2:]
These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues
Issues, they choke me like a noose

[Chorus 3:]
These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like a noose

Now I think I understand
How this world can overcome a man
Like a friend we saw it through
In the end I gave my life for you

Gave you all I had to give
Found a place for me to rest my head
While I may be hard to find
Heard there's peace just on the other side

Not that I could
Or that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn

Left this life to set me free
Took a piece of you inside of me
All this hurt can finally fade
Promise me you'll never feel afraid

Not that I could
Or that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn

I hope it's worth it
Out on the highway, yeah
I know you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you
So tell everybody
The ones who walk beside me, yeah
I hope you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you tonight

I hope it's worth it
What's left behind me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you
So tell everybody
The ones who walk beside me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you tonightOh!

I'll take you back to the beginning!
I was awoke in screams
The day that I realized there was a devil in me
(Who gives a fuck?)
If I'm a sinner conceived

By the flames you know immaculate conception is nigh
We started broken hearted, falling apart at the seams.
Don't blame me for your problems

You should fix yourself before you're gonna fix me
Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame for the hurt and the pain

I'm not the reason that you're insane

(Feels like I'm living in a madhouse!)
The smoke and mirrors you see, the devil in me shivers every time that you breathe
(Breathe down my neck!)

Go take your pills and get out
I don't understand what the fuck you're screaming about.
We're fallin' downward spiral please just let me be released.

Don't blame me for your problems
You should save yourself before you're gonna save me.
Stand back as your world decays
I can't explain why you're falling apart

You need to find someone else to blame for the hurt and the pain
(I'm not the reason that you're insane!)
Yeah, I know we've seen some better days
Now that explains why we're falling apart

You need to find someone else to blame, for the hurt and the pain

(I'm not the reason that you're insane!)
Hey! x5
I'm not (hey!) the reason that you're insane!
Stand back as your world decays, I can't explain why you're falling apart, you need to find someone else to blame for the hurt and the pain

Yeah, I know we've seen some better days
Now that explains why we're falling apart
You need to find someone else to blame, for the hurt and the pain
(I'm not the reason that you're insane!)
Hey! x5
I'm not (hey!) the reason that you're insane!Come on
I'm sick, sick of it
All of this
All the shit that clouds my judgment
Again, I'm on a bench
Makes me cringe
Everyone's a fucking cynic
Burn, burn, burn
Everything to the ground
Burn, burn, burn
Everything that's around
You better get up, get out now
Get up, get out now
Before you do something you'll regret
Get up, get out now
Get up, get out now
You're trapped in (?) napkins
Burned down mansions
Broken crashes
Cigarette ashes
Get up, get out now
Get up, get out now
Before you do something you're gonna regret
Arm twist, a sick win
Gotta get in it, and get this going
Burn, burn, burn
Everything to the ground
Burn, burn, burn
Everything that's around
You better burn, burn, burn
Get up, get out now
Get up, get out now
Before you do something you'll regret

Get up, get out now
Get up, get out now
Before you do something you're gonna regret
Started out face down
Hit the ground running

Get up, get out now
Get up, get out now
Before you do something you're gonna regret
You're gonna regretWe walk through the doorway, heard you calling from the hall
To find you in the bedroom not breathing at all
I drag your body to the cellar where we lay, the wax it melts away,
I kiss your face...

Now we are starting to love you more
Your body's on the canvas I painted on the floor

[Chorus:]
Now you wait, like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on for so long
And oh, how it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone, it's so wrong, it's so wrong...

If I could take you somewhere, I'd take you to the darkest place,
scatter you in art forms, admire the whore
beauty in different ways, your hands on picture frames
your eyes in the glass wear your face as a mask

Now they are starting to love you more
a gallery of your beauty, no charge at the door

[Chorus:]
As you wait, like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on for so long
And oh, how it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone, it's so wrong, it's so wrong...

And down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
I lost control your face is pale, your body's cold
And down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
I lost control your face is pale, your body's cold

[Chorus:]
Wait, like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on for so long
And oh, how it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone, it's so wrong, it's so wrong...

It's so wrong...[x8]This love is bittersweet. It's always incomplete.
Right now you're killing me (ohhh oh)
'Cause everything that you say, and every time that you stay,
I see that now you have changed and I'm the one that you blame.

Chorus:
NOW YOU'RE GONE!
And your on to the next one
This time I got to live without you
That's just the way it has to be
This time I got to live without you (whoa oh)
And your on to the next one.

When the night, turns to day
I know that people change but you just stay the same.
You would swear,
On your grave,
That you would never become exactly what you hate.

Chorus:
NOW YOU'RE GONE!
And your on to the next one
This time I got to live without you
Thats just the way it has to be
This time I got to live without you (Whoa ohh)
And your on to the next one
On to the next one.

Every night, turns to day,
And everyone has to change

Chorus:
NOW YOU'RE GONE
And your on to the next one
This time I got to live without you
Thats just the way it has to be
This time I got to live without you (Whoa ohh)
And your on to the next one

This time I got to live without you
That's just the way it has to be
This time I got to live without you (Whoa ohh)
And your on to the next one.

On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one.UNTIL WE DIE!

Darkness it floods the sky, like the end of days
A small piece of sanity is all that remains
It's on my brain

On the break of madness
I remember all I love
Take away the fear from this
I'm not givin' up
Not givin' up

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth And we'll always fight this battle till we die

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth and we'll always fight this battle till we die

Just like an animal
Locked inside a cage
I'm pushing back and forth
Waiting with pace
Till I can escape

We are the undead
Raising from the grave
I will fight until nothing remains
Nothing remains

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth And we'll always fight this battle till we die

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth
And we'll always fight this battle till we
Battle till we die

Don't tell me I won't succeed
It lights the fire under me

Don't tell me I won't succeed
It lights the fire
The fire under me

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth
And we'll always fight this battle till we die

We are not alone
We are searching for the truth And we'll always fight this battle till we
Battle till we die!

BATTLE TILL WE DIE!You caught my eye,
when I walked by.
Tension from the way you move,
your heart is bruised.
We sit and laugh,
it's all an act.
The lies they seep through
You're such a fool

As makeup runs down your cheeks,
you found that you are lost again.
Try to make your way back home.
Found that you're alone.

Put on your dress,
and look your best
Let this be your night.
We'll laugh and die.
So drink it down,
you need this now.
Make the pain go away,
I can't be saved.

As makeup runs down your cheeks,
You found that you are lost again.
Try and make your way back home,
Found that you're alone.

Fall down,
Searching for the perfect place for you to lose it all again.
Slow down,
Keep it at a steady pace, as i watch you fade away.

As makeup runs down your cheeks,
You found that you are lost again.
Try to make your way back home,
Found that you're alone.

As make up runs down your cheeks,
You found that you are lost again.
Try to make your way back home,
Found that you're alone.She hears a moan at the top of the stairs
But she don't move or fret, just minds her business
"I swear these walls have been talking to me", she says
"Cause all I hear are the devils wishes"
She feels his breath down her skin and bones

Crying out in pain
But no one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness

Crying out in vain
But no one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness again

By her hair he drags her in the street
He's free of others eyes, there are no glances
She cries for help with a gun to her cheek
But no one comes, nobody listens
Her blood runs red all through the street

Crying out in pain
But no one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness

Crying out in vain
But no one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness
You're lost in darkness again

I can't find my inspiration
I can't find my inspiration
I can't find my inspiration
I can't find my inspiration

Crying out in pain
But no one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness

Crying out in vain
But no one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness

Crying out again
No one knows how to find you
You're lost in darkness

Crying out in vain
No one knows how to reach you
You're lost in darkness
You're lost in darkness againOh!

Well, I hear you whisper and the words
Melts everyone but you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up

I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
And it's the same as the emotion that I get from you

You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real or else forget about it
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out

Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood

'Cause you're so smooth, smooth

it's like time just slips away.
I'm nothing, when darkness follows me.
The dawn, it never shows it's head.
I'm left dying here instead with nothing
a lock without a key.

Like the brightest star you shine through.

I hear their voices inside.
The battle's over.
This war has been won.
Visions haunt me in my dreams.
Visions of what I've done.
So much blood shed.
Now am I worthy to come home.

My God forgive me
For all of the bodies
I've taken in batter.
Oh God don't forsake me.

It's time to be set free.
So devastated.
The damage has been done.
So violated. Like I've been
raped and left for dead.
I'm lying naked.
I'm lying naked on the floor.

My God forgive me

Reach out your hands to me
and let's just disappear.

I swear to god that all of you fuckers will pay
In the end, there's no second chances
The worse is yet to come

We are the terrible children
The bringers of light and death
We are the terrible children
The bringers of light and death

With scars on our hearts we will rise (we won't fall victim)
With blood on our hands we survive (we won't fall victim)

I'm taking back the life you stole from years ago
My soul is painted in black
Here I am, traumatized and horrified
But I will not back down

We are the terrible children
The bringers of light and death
We are the terrible children
The bringers of light and death

With scars on our hearts we will rise (we won't fall victim)
With blood on our hands we survive (we won't fall victim)
Like fire we burn through the night (we'll keep on burning)
Like fire we burn through the night (we'll keep on burning)
We'll keep on burning
Death before dishonor, I will die before I falter
Death before dishonor, I will die before I falter
With scars on our hearts we will rise (we won't fall victim)
With blood on our hands we survive (we won't fall victim)
Like fire we burn through the night (we'll keep on burning)
Like fire we burn through the night (we'll keep on burning)Hurtful words,
From my enemies of the last five years,
What's it like to die alone?

How does it feel when tears freeze,
When you cry?
The blood in your veins is twenty below.

Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette,
Finger on the trigger to my dear Juliet,
Out from the window see her back drop silhouette,
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget,

So for now, take this down a notch,
Crash my car through your window,
Make sure you're still alive,
Just in time to kill you,

Something I cannot forget.You said this could only get better
There's no rush cause we have each other
You said this would last forever
But now I doubt if I was your only lover

Are we just lost in time?
I wonder if your love's the same
Cause I'm not over you

Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know
Cause girl you're driving me so crazy

...
How can I miss you if you never would stay?
If you need time I guess I'll go away (I'll go away)
Inside me now there's only heartache and pain

So where's the fire? You've become the rain
Are we just lost in time?
I wonder if your love's the same

Cause I'm not over you
Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know

Girl you're driving me so crazy
And if you don't want me than
I guess I'll have to go (I guess I'll have to go)
Not loving you is harder than you know

(Yeah)
So I'll make the call
And I'll leave today
I'm gonna miss you cause I love you baby
And I'll make the call
I'm leaving today

And leaving always drives me crazy

...
Leaving always drives me crazy
Baby, don't talk to me
I'm trying to let go

Not loving you is harder than you know
(Yeah)
Baby, don't talk to me

I'm trying to let go
Not loving you is harder than you know
Cause girl you're driving me so crazyWhy do we keep repeating,
When evil is unhealthy?
My body aches without you
Look again my hands are shaking
With you I'm terrified but follow
Me without you it's got me horrified
'cause if we're being accused. well our
Limits are never satisfied.

Chemical love! I can feel you in my bones
Chemical love! can you feel me in your
Soul? nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!

This situation's clockwork, always rising
Up from the dirt, only to repeat disaster
The way that we would. can you hide for
Me? I'm drowning in your eyes. I must
Be under a spell you've got me
Hypnotized. 'cause we're running away
But there's no ending you're always
My mind

Chemical love! I can feel you in my bones!
Chemical love! can you feel me in your
Soul? nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own!

Chemical love! I can feel you in my bones!
Chemical love! can you feel me in your
Soul? nothing you can do to save me
I am on my own! 

Chemical love!
Chemical love!
Chemical love!
Chemical love!
Chemical love!This is the death of me
I feel it constantly
Just like an enemy
That wants to see me bleed

So I try to be silent while my words
They explode like hand grenades
I just gotta stay calm, before I let
This time bomb blow up in my face

These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose

Issues, they choke me like a noose
Issues, they choke me like

The hounds have helped me cry
That's how they give to me
Inject my head with lies
The pain's astonishing

Like a flick or a stone
Slowing crushing my bones
Sending me to my grave
And if such a fate this life
That I am going insane

These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose

These issues pin me to the floor
These issues are my overlord
I feel so dominated
These issues, they choke my like a noose

Issues, issues

This is the death of me

Just like an enemy

IssuesI'm not trying to bring you down
But you're lost in the clouds
I've never been one to complain
But your world around me, kills me softly

I don't wanna be demanding
I just wanna know the reasons why
We live and die in a world of lies
Addicted to the way we crash and burn

I gave it all away, now it's your turn
Watching me, watching you
Don't wanna see the worst in you
So don't let it come true

Coming true, coming true
Coming true, coming true
Coming true, coming true
Coming true, coming true

Tore me down and made it clear
As I sunk to the bottom
I stare at space from the ocean floor
It all surrounds me, kills me softly

I don't wanna be demanding
I just wanna know the reasons why
We live and die in a world of lies
Addicted to the way we crash and burn

I gave it all away, now it's your turn
Watching me, watching you
Don't wanna see the worst in you
So don't let this come true

'Cause I don't wanna see the worst in you

This woman tours me through shadows
In her presence of light
I'm reaching out my hands
With my fingers to the sky

So tell me what I have to do, I don't wanna tell you to
I just wanna be with you, I just wanna make it through
I just wanna make it through this life
Yeah, yeah

Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna, I just wanna
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna, I just wanna
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna, I just wanna
Just wanna, just wanna, just wanna make it through this life

I don't wanna be demanding
I just wanna know the reasons why
We live and die in a world of lies
Addicted to the way we crash and burn

I gave it all away, now it's your turn
Watching me watching you
Don't wanna see the worst in you
So don't let this come true

'Cause I don't wanna see the worst in you
