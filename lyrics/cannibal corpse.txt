Experimental pathogens, a devil's design
The dark side of science breeds a weapon of war
Contagious killing and internal distress
Homicide or suicide will be the cause of death

Internal organs altered by the disease
Your brain disabled by the constant pain
Erratic actions lead my thoughts to the blade
I've lost control, I've lost control

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread, you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Stabbing compulsion overwhelms my mind
Terrorized screaming follows the thrust of my knife
I wrench the blade from the chest to the crotch
Organs and entrails fall to the ground

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread, you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plague

Unable to be seen but with visible effect
Virulent disease causing outbreaks of violence
They tear themselves apart, offal covers the ground
Viscera torn forcefully from the abdomen

Intestines slick with blood cannot escape my grip
Surgical incisions give way to frenzied carving
Delirium has taken hold, disembowelment is complete
Horror grips my mind, my entrails are in my hands
My entrails are in my hands, my entrails are in my hands

Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death

Disease will spread and cover the world
Mass insanity, the end of our time
Scavengers will eat the remains of man
Our extinction was by our design

Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread, you pray for death
Evisceration plague

Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plagueBleeding

Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine

Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave

Live, life

Dead for years, now alive
The dead came to life

Dead creatures out for blood
After death we will awaken
Unhuman beings from beyond
Rotting zombies out for blood

Bleed, bleed

Bleeding through my pores
Clotted pus, crusts my skin
My body cold but I live on
Bleeding

The dead awaken, living rotten
Rotten living dead

Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine

Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave

Live, life, deadCadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It wall will end in the dirt again

He starts with the draining of liquid mass
His victims lie helpless and wide awake
Bodies are shriveled to skeletal form
To decompose
Victims die helpless while siphoned awake

Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot

Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It will all end in the dirt again

Bone matter is now removed from the skin
Collection of remurs used to impale
Scattered skulls with oozing brains left unfound
To decompose
Splitting the spines like he's done it before

Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered wait to rot

Morbid fascination with the dead
Bones blood brutally dissolved
Constant threat of killing all he sees
Revenge always gets involved

Morbid inclination warps his mind
Terror saturates his eyes
Foreseen decimation feeds his mind
Starving for the next attack

Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It will all end in the dirt again

Left to be one with the dirt again
It all will end in the dirt again

Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
Twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole
Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity
The smell was unbearable As I unburied her
I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
Down her throat, swallow
Eyes glassy and vacant
Body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
Tonguing her rotted anus
I need a live woman
To fill with my fluid
A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill
Her body exceptional
She thought I was normal
But I wanted more
I came blood inside of her
Choking on the clot
Gagging on the snot
Gushing blood, from her mouth
Bloody gel leaking out
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
The sickness I have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
The greatest thrill of my life
Violent, climax Serging serum on my skin
Back from the dead
I am resurrected to spew, putrefactionFlying chunks of hot debris rushing through the air
Vapors causing blisters eyes blinded by the glare
Clouds that shower death hell falling from the sky
Searing rain of molten rock, flesh begins to fry

Burning fragments, steaming stones tearing through my skin
Lodging near my organs, I'm burning from within
Parts of human bodies lay strewn on the ground
Survivors holding bleeding ears, deafened by the sound

Blackened heavens down a mountain's weight
Of rock on top of us
Churning earth has somehow come to life
Rapid combustion spewing magma cracks apart the crust
Tornadoes of caustic steam ravaging the earth

Scalding hail

Charred and battered victims crying to be saved
Falling on deaf ears the earth is now our grave
Devastating torrents acid drowns the land
No relief from scalding hail burning like a brand

People shrieking as they die, pounded by the hail
Splintered shards, heated rocks stabbing like a nail
Millions have been slaughtered as the boiling torrent falls
Apocalyptic storm, judgment for us all

Scalding hailSharpen the pick
To pierce the skull through the ear
Stab at an angle
Cranial transfixion, hearing and vision
Terminated by the penetration

Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind

Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real

Struggle with death
In shock you grasp at the air
Senses deprived
Cerebral cessation, mental division
Created by this perforation

Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind

Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real

Boring through the brain, eye impaled upon the point
Steel spears crisscross your gray matter
Puncturing the eardrum and the blood begins to ooze
Red blooms grace the dying head

Auditory nerve is severed
Labyrinth destroyed
You are rendered deaf and blind
Seconds before death

On a spit your head will burn
Charring flesh, brain tissue congeals
Crack the skull, open wide
Scoop it out, I consume your mind

Eating the brain
To gain the knowledge of death
You are inside
Psychic absorption, hearing and vision
Are now mine through this appropriation

Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind

Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is realScourged through searing
Incandescence
Melt together
Fire torture brings me intense pain

Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold
As one as my blood is boiling

Blowtorch slaughter
Bodily capitulation
Blowtorch slaughter

Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration
Blowtorch slaughter

Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold
As one as my blood is boiling

Conflagration through my veins
Desensitized, charring skin, burnt within
Branded soul, torrid cruelty

Conflagration, towards the veins

Dwidle away, glowing heat to mutilate
Head set ablaze, consumed in flames
I burn to the ground

Blowtorch slaughter

Pre-destined to incinerate
The flesh is dripping from my face
My limbs and torso mold
As one as my blood is boiling

Blowtorch slaughter
Merciless disintegration

Tomb Of The Mutilated
Split Wide Open
Melting thoughts of disintegration
Hitting deep her insistance
to mutilate her newborn infants
After giving birth her mind wasn't the same
Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay
Family now complete
Father watches on
As mother dismembers
her newborn son

Dissecting the specimen, split
I will explore, the body wide open
Uncover carnage within, split wide open
Virgin, untouched skin
Releasing her rage
That dwells inside
tainted blood rushes through veins
her body chemically changed
Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's
knife

The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse
every nine months she butchers one more child
Reminders of the deceased, scattered through
the home

bones and skulls of sons and daughters
Genitals ferment
In jars inside the cupboards
for father to dissect
No one will discover the murder they commit

Children used like laboratory rats
Sickening vulgar experiments
She sees what others can't
Probing the guts of her fetus
Advocation of the pain
Mutilating, draining veins

Witness the horror
offering to themselves
Continuing murdering
their own kind
Never deny
this fantasy life, they enjoy
Addiction to this heightened state
Post-birth psychosis
disjointing her own children
form the life they'll never live
A massacre within her soul
Struggling for controlA relapse of my body
Sends my mind into multiple seizures
Psychologically a new human being
One that has never been

Cursed by the shamen
His voodoo spell has my soul
My limbs go numb
I can't control my own thought

Are his now
His evil consuming me
Ever telling me
Begin the clit carving

Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie
Knowing this spell can only be broken
By the vaginal skins of young women
I proceed to find the meat

Their bleeding cunts will set me free
Warmth seeping from this
Body rotted
After I sucked the blood from her ass

I feel more alive
More alive than I've ever been
Even though now I'm dead within

My mouth drools as I slice your perineum
My body smeared with the guts I've extracted
Through her hole, came swollen organs
Cunnilingus with the mutilated

My spirit returned from the dead
Released by the priest
But I felt more real when I was dead

The curse is broken
I have a dependence on vaginal skin
It's become my sexual addiction
I must slit, the twitching clit
Rotted cavity hold the juice

Between the legs, I love to carve
My cock is dripping with her bloodFollow the one evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead, speeches laced with hate
Leading the dense the bovine human herd
Inherently stupid, the fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins, cities are ablaze
Tortured screams, skin turning black
Carbonization, they will all burn
Mass execution, they will all die

Burning the world and all of it's life
Throwing all the people in a pit of fire
Watching the sheep gathering to die
Followers in life, follow to the grave

Follow the one evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead, speeches laced with hate
Leading the dense, the bovine human herd
Inherently stupid, the fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins, cities are ablaze
Tortured screams, skin turning black
Carbonization, they will all burn
Mass execution they will all die

Pile the bodies, set them aflame
The human race, sentenced to burn
Burning flesh, miasma of their death
Civilization, it is destroyed

Pits of corpses, unholy grave of war
Hanging victims, guilty of free thought

Coroner
Completes his task

Examining the wretched stiff
Suicide
The likely cause

Behind closed doors the change
Begins
Then it grows
Mutilation of the cadaver
Mutilation of the cadaver

Coroner returns to notice
Subtle change
How can this be?

Must be his imagination
The man's been dead
For several days

The change continues after hours
Different face
Mutilation of the cadaver
Soon the corpse will change its shape
Who is it?

Mutilation of the cadaver
Mutilation of the cadaver
Mutilation of the cadaver
Mutilation of the cadaver

The coroner returns and sees
The body has truly changed
The corpse has stolen his face
And now he loses his mind

Shocking evolution
Mutilation of the cadaver
Hideous conversion
Mutilation of the cadaver

Postmortem upheaval
Mutilation of the cadaver
Awful transformation
Mutilation of the cadaver

Gruesome reconstruction
Mutilation of the cadaverAlive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied
I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony
Eyes in the darkness, echoing their madness

The sights that have passed before them
Watching as though it has never happened
Now I only listen to what is not spoken

Murder, hatred, anger, savage
Killings I have caused more than can be counted
Orgies of sadism and sexual perversion
Virgin tied to my mattress, legs spread wide

Ruptured bowel, yanked from her insides
Devirginized with my knife, internally bleeding
Vagina, secreting her blood-wet pussy

I am eating on her guts, I am feeding
Mutilated with a machete
I fucked her dead body, the first and last

Your life's only romance
My knife's jammed in your ass
As you die you orgasm

Pass on to the dead
Nerve trembling convulsions
No longer looking human

I never see them but I know they're there
Locked in my subconscious
Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten
Haunting unrealities tear at me

Hold her arms, her mouth taped shut
Screams unheard outpour her guts

Layers of flesh peeling away
Languish in your own decay
Descriptions of my killings, bone chilling

Terror, tear, her, virgin cunt

Virgins are my victims
Their tight interiors I explore
Sharpened utensils of torture
Now inserted inside of her
Sex organs extracted for eating
On her liver, I am gnawing

Forbidden lust for guts
Ripped from her cunt
Tears of blood cry down her thigh

I ram my fist inside her hole
From her crotch piss now flows
Rectum filled with shit
I fucked her emptied body
Until she became stiffThe blackened city calls out
Enter the temple of sin
You must enter the temple of sin

Contorted sinners beckon
Join our twisted rites
You must join our twisted rites

The priests eyes gleam
Blood on their scepters of flesh
There is blood on their scepters of flesh

The nubile virgin bows
Await the piercing thrust
She awaits the piercing thrust

Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned
Praise the gods of sin

Her walls are burning
Grinding the staff of the priest
Sluts grinding the staff of the priest

The congregation
Revel in sins of the flesh
They revel in sins of the flesh

Whores from the temple
Serving shamanic desire
They are serving shamanic desire

Deviant bodies writhing
Slick with the fluids of lust
They are slick with the fluids of lust

Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned

Immortal lust
Wicked legions come forth
Defile the pure

Statues of demons glisten with sweat
The orgy intensifies violence begins
Flagellate sluts with serpentine whips

They raise their blades to throats of their men
Climax approaches and the blood will spill
Sexual sacrifice, mutilation and death
Murder

Priests of Sodom

Tomb Of The Mutilated
Necropedophile
I was once a man before I transformed
into this molester, freshly deceased children
You have born, torn by my raoe
The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse
I will violate

Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction
I open the coffin
Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare
At the dead, over and over, I can't escape
I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice
I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy
for nine days straight I do the same
She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave
her neck I hack, cutting through the back
I use her mouth to eject

Here I cum, blood gushes from
bleeding black blood
her head disconnected
As I came, viciously I cut, through her
jugular vein
She's already dead, I masturbate with
her severed head
My lubrication, her decomposition
Spending my life molesting dead children

Intercourse with infants
Curing heads on top of spikes
boiling skulls
Skin sliding off of bones

Voices
The voices call
Voices
The voices are calling me
Buried dead I've spiritually infected
Call to me from beyond their graves

Bleed
I now bleed pus
I bleed, the blood of the dead
I bleed on her livid skin
Thrusting myself within
Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch
Beyond what we know as death
It haunts me everyday
I hear the voice of every child
That lies next to me decayed
A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection
Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled

Violated after death
Virgin hole infest
Anal pore spewing cess
The sacred juice I injest
Your dead child I defile
NecropedophileThere's something inside me
It's, it's coming out, I feel like killing you
Let loose the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold

Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life

The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead
Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet

I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
Through the cracks, blood does leak
Distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me
Lifeless body, slouching dead Lecherous abscess
Where you once had a head

Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half

Crushing, cranial, contents
Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon

Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions
Suffer, and then you die Torture, pulverized
At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me
Created to kill, the carnage continues

Violently reshaping human facial tissue
Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your foreheadGrotesque, crippled, carved up carcass
Evil controlling my mind
The fear of dying expired of life, to vomit the soul
I am dead within myself

The end a beginning to a new life in hell
I am your path to ever-lasting pain
Mass extinction of the human population
Son of the devil the evil incarnation

Maniacal mass murderer mutilating mortals
The child born unto evil, trapped within the statue of flesh
Vipers travel through bodily orifices
Blessed by the Devil under inverted crosses

Religious ways, lies controlling minds
I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves I search for decay packs
Of flesh driven zombies ready to feast
I suffer forever living only to dismember

Open season on humans
Laughing I watch them die, they bleed so easily
Their blood flows through my body
I need to taste the flesh exposing pulsing arteries

Removing vital organs
Not stopping till you've died
Puts from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore
Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts

Constricted corpuscles coagulating blood
My drug a slave to its taste
Reincarnated to human form, creating a race of immortal beings
Rot away dead bodies, set a flame

Searing flesh, broken necks
You can't kill what already dead
De-evolution, hunting for life
Cannibalism, immortality rip and slash

A society of mass murder bleeding slow
I take away your life
And leave you lying cold, decapitated body
Searching for its head

Anticipate apocalypse, rising dead dismembering
Hacking limbs bleeding, cracking ribs torture us
Blessed by the devil, under inverted crosses
Religious ways, lies controlling minds

I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves, desolate
Empty hollow corpse, desecrate forced
To eat your flesh extracting purity violate
Twisted bodies, rot awayInto the abyss, perpetual and torturous
The gallery of suicide, internal torment
Archaic carcasses, displayed degeneracy
Once within these walls a life of death will be unleashed

Forever dying are the dead, countless bleeding heads
Cadavers splattered red from the self-slicing of necks
Stenching maggot filled bodies, skulls and bones rot away
The slaughtered souls that chose to die, enveloped in death

Darkness is the only light, suicide the way
Hideous forms of human death, mounds of flesh slowly decay
Embrace the horrid nature, carnage on display

Pain never felt enslaved inside this massive grave
Life, evil fate, only slaves to death can survive this place
Die, perdition, penance in putrid decadence
Dead miscreants enter the decrepit necropolis

Lurid interment in the hellish abattoir
Impetuosity and horror, after-life is tortured
Entrails, guts, and blood is this museums decor

Blood, impiety, chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical, they perish, the victims of vagary
Vile tragedy with great vehemence the hapless died
Kill, suicide, serrated blades assist in destiny

Death opened the gallery, sarcophagus
Ecstasy in suffering, imprecation

Blood, impiety, chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical, they perish, the victims of vagaryWhy can't I breathe*
Still I see
Dead on the table
Try to move, I'm not able to

They said I have died
I still feel alive
I won't believe their lies
Still see through these
Eyes

Help me, I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead

Knives cutting into me
Scalpels rip me
Screaming into deaf ears
Now they stop and see my tears

Help me, I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead

I can't stop the visions
Stop the premonitions

My soul can't escape
The boundary of my flesh
My heart does not beat
My spirit does not rest

They said I have died
I still feel alive
I won't believe their lies
I can still see through these eyes[Incomprehensible] decay of life

Adversaries will cower
In the wake of his appearance
Clad with remains of their friends

Bludgeoning them with power
As they strain to make a defense
The bringer of death descends

Skull fragment armor
It’s a trophy of war

Pieces of cleft craniums shield the gore

Towering clad in bone
Cranial plate mail spattered
With the blood and brains of the foe

Murdering dozens alone
Countless skeletons shattered
Rivers of fresh blood will flow

Skull fragment armor
Designed by the cruel

Decimation is the only rule

Hewing through a frightened face
His rotting visage gleaming
Demented lust for violence and pain

Impervious to counter-strikes
He mangles without feeling
Only satisfied when all he sees are slain

Another head collapses
His spiked club dripping brain
Torrents of blood are gushing from the hole

Towering over corpses
Nothing here still living
He begins to scavenge, a killer with no soul

Their blind age endless, no mercy lay waste
Wipe out, kill them, kill them

Their struggle to defend
The attack will never end
Surrounded by disgust
Pounded into dust

Butchery
SavageWalk away into the dark
Come my way, terror
I am the evil within each soul
I take the spirits of those I kill

Murdered

Decomposition, the body rots
Rotting, rotting body parts
I killed the first
To experiment

I don't want to hurt you
I just want to kill you

Torture, I start to cut
Carving, blood slowly clots
Horrors, mutilations
Homicidal experimentation

I set the dead on fire
To decay in flame
Homicidal desire

More are marked for murder
More victims to capture

Butchered

Bodies hang dead
Drained of all their blood
Pieces sewn on backwards
Neck with no heads, mutilated, dead

Homicidal desire
More are marked for murder
More victims to butcherFlesh starts to rip, gouging through skin
From the throat blood gushes
Glandular eruption, blistered skin secretion
Internal punctures, blood regurgitation

Gagging, choking on broken glass

Shredded muscle tissue
Wounds too deep to heal
Severed esophagus, tongue split in half
Lungs fill with blood as vocal chords collapse

Oral sex with broken glass
Ruptured flesh ripped through the neck
Mutilate pulsing veins, sliced windpipe

Flesh starts to rip, gouging through skin
From the throat blood gushes
Glandular eruption, blistered skin secretion

Wounds too deep to heal in me

Torn trachea, splintered skin, down the throat choke
Lungs fill with blood as vocal chords collapse
Oral sex with broken glass
