I thought I knew it all
I've been through the highs
Said all my goodbyes
Learned to run before I learned to crawl

It's not worth fighting for
If one of us is sure
And one of us is dying
Trying to find love's cure

I've waited all my life
To paint these cities red
The thoughts I've always had here
Stuck inside my head

It's not worth waiting for
If one of us wants more
And one of us is dying
Trying to find love's door

When we learn how to fly, we forget how to walk
When we learn how to sing, wanna hear each other talk
Here we are at the finish line
Here we are at the finish line

And you, you really thought you knew
Everything to do with holding on to me
But holding on this time is making me slip right through your hands
And now you don't understand
Trying to find love all yourself

When we learn how to fly, we forget how to walk
When we learn how to sing, don't wanna hear each other talk
When we know what we want, we forget what we need
When you find who you are, you forget about me

Here we are at the finish line
Here we are at the finish line
Here we are at the finish lineNow that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change

Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June

But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated

And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly
So he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?

Tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love
Pride, deep-fried chicken?
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong

Can you imagine no first dance?
Freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?

And tell me did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded?
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?

Na na na
And did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day?

Na na na
And did you fall for a shooting star?
Fall for a shooting star
Na na na
And now you're lonely looking for yourself out thereTrain

Simple Life
Mother Nature and the elephant man
Refill prescription to the radio land
Tatoos and interviews, another way to say
you've grabbed us by the balls and taken us away
Halleluja, another video
surgically removed, reimproved, its the way to go

I was raised on cigarettes and jazz
cheap drive-in movies and soul
now I live in basements and flats
where did the simple life go?

Talk show, talk show,
talk about nothing that you really wanna know, talk show
Freak show, peep show,
you're on the cover of a magazine, in between
there is a scene that you really wanna know

I was raised on alcohol and blues
front porches and the front page of the Sunday news
now I live in silicone crowds
where did the simple life go?

Halleluja, another video
surgically removed, reimproved, its the way to go
Halleluja, you changed your hair
now you want to change the world

I was raised on baseball and football
didn't even know their names
now I live in a suicide trap
where did the simple life go?While everybody else is getting out of bed*
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it

My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger
I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life

But I'm afraid when I hear stories
About a husband and wife
There's no happy endings
No Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

[Chorus:]
If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, Love
That's enough for me

Took a loan on a house I own
Can't be a queen bee without a bee throne
I wanna buy ya everything
Except cologne
'cause it's poison
We can travel to Spain
where the rain falls mainly on the plain
Sounds insane
'cause it is we can laugh we can sing
Have ten kids and give them everything
Hold our cell phones up in the air
And just be glad we made it here alive
On a spinning ball in the middle of space
I love you from your toes to your face

[Repeat Chorus:]

You can move in
I won't ask where you've been
'cause everybody has a past
When we're older
We'll do it all over again

When everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
I'm in it for you

If it's love
And we're two birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever
Then the rest is just whatever

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them two birds of a feather
That flock together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
Got to have something to keep us together
Love, love
That's enough for meHere I'm on the road again
With my favorite lie
Can't keep up with where I've been
But it helps me hide

Taking a hold of all of the adulation
Keeping my favorite point of view
I'm sailing away from all of the expectation
Baby, I'm better off with you

When you're home all by yourself
I can't get down with it
I can't get up with it
I can't help thinking I'd be better off dead
And I know myself by now
I place all my forecourt prayers

I'm taking my turn with all these evolutions
Keeping my house on where I can
(Maybe I'm better off with you)
Sailing away from all these expectations
'Cos everything's better when it's new

Well, it's easier said than it's easier done
Then you feel like you lost if I feel like I've won
And it's been crazier than it's ever been
Ever been but I miss you

Hanging myself on all these elevations
Crossing my heart and hoping to fly
(Maybe I'm better off alive)
Falling in love with all of these expectation
Maybe I'm better off alive
(Maybe I'm better off alive)

Maybe I'm better off alive
(Maybe I'm better off alive)
Maybe I'm better off alive
I'm alive, I'm aliveI don't mind lying if it stops the pain
There's no use denying, I've lost the train of thought
I had before I left, now I'm alone
The place I left behind, had I known

I'm counting on you
I'm all around you
I'm counting on you
To take me home

You sit back in your easy chair and tell me out the whole affair
You say I'm gonna be something some day
It sounds so easy, the way you please me
Well, you say I'm on the right track
But I think that it's time that I get back home

I'm counting on you
I'm all around you
I'm counting on you
To take me home

Something in the wind ain't right
There's something on the faces in the streets at night
There is so much on my mind
Well, you say it's here in front of me
But it's something I can't find no more

Something in the wind ain't right
There's something on the faces in the streets at night
There is so much on my mind
Well, you say it's here in front of me
But it's something I can't find no more

I'm counting on you
I'm all around you
I'm counting on you
To take me homeTrain

Inspite of Ourselves
by John Prine and Iris Dement

She don't like her eggs all runny
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
She looks down her nose at money
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny
She's my baby I'm her honey
I'm never gonna let her go

He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
He's my baby
And I'm his honey
Never gonna let him go

In spite of ourselves
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds
Honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
Dancin' in our eyes.

She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs
She takes a lickin'
And keeps on tickin'
I'm never gonna let her go.

He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a wacked out werido and a lovebug junkie
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon
He's my baby I don't mean maybe
Never gonna let him go

In spite of ourselves
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds
Honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses
Right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts
Dancin' in our eyes.
In spite of ourselvesPast the breakers, sliver by you never try you
On the tuffet that you never were afraid of
Anyone that was not you

In the corner, tried to warn her I, I, I
Caught in traffic in the middle of the night
In the middle of the highway

The highway
Got your hands in the dirt
Got your head in the grass
You're tryin' to hold on to some of your

Past the test now
You're runnin' outta breath no one behind you
On the subject of Religion decision devision

Collision, provision, cold hard television
Collective bargaining and talk radio radio
Your mother your brother your sister your lover

Your Father whom art in Heaven
Got to be home by eleven if you wanna be a good girl
You got your hands in the dirt
Got your head in the highwayTrain

Avery
She holds his clothes in the dark
rocking them she whispers
her hand falls slowly from her neck
to her left a streetlight dances gently through a window
it hurts to say his name
she swears she can hear him calling her, hey Avery

there between her craving and imagination
it falls into the night
the air is still and he's still calling her, hey Avery
Is there room enough for me, its been so long
Is there something you should say to me, Avery?

pity drives him down, his candle burning out
she thought it was the answer
her pity drives her down, her years are burning out
she thought it was the answer
her cross still hanging in the corner
she's afraid to take it down
it reminds her she's gotta start life over

hey Avery, Is there room enough for me, its been so long
Is there something you should say to me, Avery?

pity drives him down, his candle burning out
she thought it was the answer
her pity drives her down, her years are burning out
she's dying from the answer

she wears his picture on a chain
she prays that the pain won't last forever
and I know that she's still praying
that the pain won't last forever
there between her craving and imagination
it falls into the night
the air is still and he's still calling her, hey Avery
why wasn't there room enough for me?Ho, ho, ho...
Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness
It's Christmas time
There was a story that I was told
And I want to tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list
Shake it up, shake up the happiness

A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Clause would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground and family above
Can you send some happiness with my best
To the rest of the people of east and the west
And maybe every once in a while
You give my a grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season to smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
And let me meet a girl one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free
And she can open some happiness with me
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time

Climbin up on thirty
Dress like a kid to make me feel young punk
And talk junk, you musta fell out of your bunk
And smacked your head or your face or somethin

I dont need nobody
Flyin in my jet stream
Take the bus, go on and
Get yourself your own dream

'Cause this is my own life keepin me down
Where I wanna be in my private nation
Im alone all thinkin lifes a phone call
Here for just a while when in my private nation
You can ride or you can go

Why you gonna step on shoes
When you dont know whose been in em
Have you ever been more than a bump
On a rock that likes to roll
In the middle of a soup bowl in the sky
Use your eyes, its all you got till you die

I dont need nobody
Flyin in my jet stream
Take the bus, go on and
Get yourself your own dream

'Cause this is my own life keepin me down
Where I wanna be in my private nation
Im alone all thinkin lifes a phone call
Here for just a while when in my private nation
You can ride on, it aint free
Leave a light on, so you can see
How to get back when you go

How to get, how to give
How to make ends meet
How to lose, how to win
How to stay on the seat

How to use momentum
To make the two wheels straight
How to wait after it feels
Like you waited so long

I dont need nobody
Flyin in my jet stream
Take the bus, go on and
Get yourself your own dream

'Cause this is my own life keepin me down
Where I wanna be in my private nation
Im alone all thinkin lifes a phone call
Here for just a while when in my private nation, yeah

This is my own life keepin me down
Where I wanna be in my generation
Im alone all thinkin lifes a phone call
Here for just a while when in my private nation
You can ride on, it aint free
Leave a light on, so you can see
How to get backLet's blame it on something else
Blame it on the architects, the full moon
Anything but ourselves

How else we gonna get through the night
Cuz you're never wrong
and I'm not strong enough to tell
you what I'm thinking

Sometimes
it's not enough to be right
These times are never easy

Should we believe?
Should we believe in
I don't care which road we take
If it leads me back to you
If you could see what I'm feeling
I just want my best friend back again
Should we believe?

I can hear you down the hall
There's no more numbers left to call now
It's me you need to talk to
I used to be the one on the other line
Until I traded in that friend of mine
For a kiss that led to love
and love has led to this

Should we believe?
Should we believe in
I don't care which road we take
If it leads me back to you
If you could see what I'm feeling
I just want my best friend back again
Should we believe?

Should we believe?
Sometimes it's not enough to be right
These times are never easy

If you could see what I'm feeling
I just want my best friend back again

Blame it on something else
anything but ourselves

Créditos: Amanda J.On the other side of a street i knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
This must be deja vu
But i thought this can't be true
Cause you moved to west l.a or new york or santa fe
Or where ever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause i was all through
Oh i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because i really fell for you

Oh i swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh i swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And i loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the "how you been"
And get down to the "more than friends" at last

Oh but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't leave you until i came to
Oh i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because i really fell for you

Oh i swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

When you move me everything is groovy

The way you do me
Oh i swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

Please believe that when i leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

You were my ticket outta here
And I was your dream come true
You gave me everything I ever wanted
Except for you

I convinced myself that over don't mean over
And I convinced myself that I could fix it all
Two dreams collided maybe we got too excited for our own good

No more - hold on we can make it
No more holding each other while the words all break it
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end

Now I convinced myself that nothing could ever tear me away
And I convinced myself that we'd look back and laugh at this one day
Two lives collidin' baby
We got too excited for our own good

No more - hold on we can make it
No more holding our breath while the truth all breaks it
Move on ya know we'll be stronger in the end

Hey wait hey don't you know that this is where the whole thing went wrong
Hey wait hey don't you wanna hear what I have to say
Hey wait hey don't you know that this is where the strong go on

And all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was you

No more - hold on we can make it
No more holding each other while the world tries to break us
Move on ya know we'll be stronger in the end

Hey wait hey don't you know that this is where the whole thing went wrong
Hey wait hey don't you wanna hear what I have to say
Hey wait hey don't you know this is where the strong will go on

And all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was youHey, Hey, Hey Only you Can make this world seem right Only you Can make the darkness bright
Only you And you alone Can thrill me like you do.
And fill my heart With love for only you
Only you can make this change in me For its true you are my destiny when you hold my hand I understand.
The magic that you do.
Youre my dream come true.
My one and only you.Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say

Afraid to let go
The only two who understood this place
And as far as we know
We were way before our time
As bold as we were blind
Just another perfect mistake
Another bridge to take
On the way to letting go

This ain't goodbye
This is just where love goes
When words aren't warm enough
To keep away the cold
Oh no, this ain't goodbye
It's not where our story ends
But I know you can't be mine
Not the way you've always been
As long as we've got time
Then this ain't goodbye
Oh no, this ain't goodbye

We were stars up in the sunlit sky
That no one else could see
Neither of us thought to ever ask why
It wasn't meant to be
Maybe we were way too high
To ever understand
Baby, we were victims of all
All the foolish plans
We began to divide

But this ain't goodbye
This is just where love goes
When words aren't warm enough
To keep away the cold
Oh no, this ain't goodbye
It's not where our story ends
But I know you can't be mine
Not the way you've always been
As long as we've got time

Your lipstick stains, 
on the front lobe of my left side brains.
I knew I wouldn't forget ya, 
and so I went and let you blow my mind.

Your sweet moon-beam! 
The smell of you in every single dream I dream.
I knew when we collided, 
you're the one I have decided, 
Who's one of my kind.

Hey, Soul Sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know!
Hey, Soul Sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight!

Hey! Hee-eey! Hee-ee-ee-ee-eey! Hee-ee-ee-ee-eey!

Just in time! I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me!
You gave my life direction,
A game show love connection, we can't deny, I...I, I, 

I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest!
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna!
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind..

Hey, Soul Sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know!
Hey, Soul Sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug, 
Watching you's the only drug I need.
Y'so gangster, I'm so thug, 
You're the only one I'm dreaming of! You see,
I can be myself now, finally!
In fact there's nothing I can't be! 
I want the world to see you be, with me, 

Hey, Soul Sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know!
Hey, Soul Sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight...

Hey, Soul Sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do...
Tonight!
Hey! Hee-eey! Hee-ee-ee-ee-eey! Hee-ee-ee-ee-eey! tonight! 
Hey! Hee-eey! Hee-ee-ee-ee-eey! Hee-ee-ee-ee-eey!
Tonight.We do not have the lyrics for The News yet.Not too smart, just out of school
A teachers pet and modern fool
Talked about being a freelance broker
But the police caught him tryin to choke her
Can't describe him in his corner
Like a rat out of the water
Out of work and outta grass
Mother Mary, never seems to stop to talk, she just walk on past
Down Down, no information one day always away
But why why, can't I see you
One day always away
Why why can't I be you
One day always away
He's outta school now, just another taken barstool
and this neighborhood ain't what he had in mind
wants to be your girlfriend, love to be your boyfriend
wants to be your telephone, wants to wants to be your man
But why why, can't I see you
One day always away
Why why can't I be you
One day always away
Down Down, no informationYou want it all right now, let's hurry up and wait
Girl, you right on time, trust me, you're not too late
I hate to see you rain, those mascara tears
But you can drown in the water beyond your years

Just don't grow up so fast
You don't want to know what I know yet
Maybe on paper it looks better way up here
Don't you hurry, try to take it slow
You will get there before you know it
Ain't just the bad times, the good times too shall pass
So don't grow up so fast

The world will turn, shadows fall
There's your pencil marks in the corner on the kitchen wall
Yeah, to remind you some

Just don't grow up so fast
You don't want to know what I know yet
Maybe on paper it looks better way up here
Don't you hurry, try to take it slow
You will get there before you know it
Ain't just the bad times, the good times too shall pass
So don't grow up so fast

Just don't grow up so fast
You don't want to know what I know yet
Maybe on paper it looks better way up here
Don't you hurry, try to take it slow
You will get there before you know it
Ain't just the bad times, the good times too shall pass
There's only so much sand in the hour glass
So don't grow up so fast
By Malek DakhoulHo, ho, ho...
Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness
It's Christmas time
There was a story that I was told
And I want to tell the world before I get too old
And don't remember it, so let's December it
And reassemble it, oh yeah
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho,
Ho, ho, ho,
It's Christmas time
At the same town miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Clause would hear him say
I got dreams and I got love
I got my feet on the ground and family above
Can you send some happiness with my best
To the rest of the people of east and the west
And maybe every once in a while
You give my a grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season to smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
And let me meet a girl one day
That wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free
And she can open some happiness with me
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow wear
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Then love will grow in
They believe again
Shake it up (shake it up), shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho,
Ho, ho, ho,
It's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Shake it up, shake up the happiness
Wake it up, wake up the happiness
Come on all, it's Christmas time
Ho, ho, ho,
Ho, ho, ho,
Ho, ho, ho,
It's Christmas timeWell this is just between us
but between us let's get high

In pictures I have seen her
and to see her is truly fine

She's on fire She's on fire
Flowers in her evening set

I get the feeling she won't forget
And there's times you'd long to be her
but to be her is surely blinding

She's on fire She's on fire
She's on to me and now I'm over me
She's on fire

And if I could be inside her light
I would steal enough to make my way into the night

And if I could be inside her light I might just find I'd be alright
Well it's not just a daydream if you decide to make it your life your life

And this is not between us but between us let's keep getting back to where it's from
She's on fire She's on fire
She's on to me and now I'm over me
She's on fire
She's on to me and now I'm over me
She's over me and now I'm over her
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
