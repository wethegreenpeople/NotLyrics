What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

What I've got, you've got to get it, put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it, put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it, put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize, I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaizer

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a king pin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me say hell, yes

I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart, get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley, poet and a prophet

Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

My mom I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drinkin' my juice young love chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver

Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho

Sir Psycho Sexy that is me
Sometimes I find, I need to scream

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
Theres a devil in my dick
And some demons in my semen
Good God, no that would be treason

Believe me Eve she gave good reason
Botty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
[Incomprehensible] a givin' 'cause she's the receiver

I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper

Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
He's the man that I met 1 time
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
He's the man that left me blind

Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
He's the man, he's the man, he's the man
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
Yeah

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile
She said, "Get out and spread your legs"
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you

She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said, "What's up? Now suck my dick"
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand

On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white

Unzipped and slipped, ooo that's tight
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
Well, I'm the man that you met 1 time
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
Well, I'm the man that'll leave you blind

Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
Well, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
Yeah

Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mama that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill

To be with you, to kiss with you
I do miss you, I love you

Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down

Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked

Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap, snap
Girl gettin' off all in my lap

The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooo and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a whileTo finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house, now let me spin

Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free and I'm the patient

Black and white, a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream, don't let me go
A purple stain I know

Knock on wood, we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did, did what you said
What's the point, yo what's the spread

Black and white, a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know

And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house, now let me spin

Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Let's sleep weeping willow

Black and white, a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream, don't let me go
A purple stain I know

And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in HollywoodThere must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me, I don't care
You see, so what if I bleed?

I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real

A mountain never seems to have, the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling, I got from you
The things I said to you were true

I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real

Could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

But now she's gone, yes, she's gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared

Could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

Please start dirty
 It’s 7:30
 Loss of mind and
 Cat alertly
 My best, your rest
 Send your call
 And then I nest

 Perversity in features
 Adversity that teaches
 Some call love more
 Soon I’ll call the rhythm song

 It’s over
 It’s over now
 So long to doo-doo-ra
 It’s over
 It’s over now
 I dare not get a look

 Be yourself
 Some let her call
 Never fall
 See yourself
 Sit alone and wait
 To my own call

 Go ballistic
 Anarchistic
 Smack my mouth and
 Then you kissed it
 So long, my gun
 Simple run and
 Letter bum

 Things are looking good on paper
 Once when I was in your favor
 This kiss from a mess
 Send my girl riddle less

 It’s over
 It’s over now
 So long to riddle songs
 It’s over
 It’s over now
 I dare not read a song

 See yourself
 Sad, alone and wait
 To my own brawl
 Free yourself
 There’s an only count
 This stands for all of them

 Just play at any tempo
 Going mad and going mental
 All balm, said no
 Just to let him put it wrong

 It’s over now
 It's time to get along
 It’s over
 It’s over now

He said that she can hear my baby screaming to me "fuck me"
every day, when I'm in the hay.

And then the rest is agreed upon.Close to my skin, I'm falling in, someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone, I'm left alone in another zone
John says to live above hell and my will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail and my will could sail, yeah

It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream and when I walk alone
I listen to our secret theme

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun 'cause that there is one that knows where I'm from
I care for you, I really do, I really do
Come closer now, so you can lie right by my side
Sit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you, I'm getting over myself, yeah

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Close to my skin, someone who's been, I'm a falling in
Disasters are just another star falling in my yard
John says to live above hell, my will is well
Long to be with someone to tell, I love your smellSometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend

Is the city I live in,
The city of Angel
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause
She's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause
She knows who I am

She sees my good deeds and
She kisses the windy
I never worry now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way yeah yeah yeah

It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone

At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love

Castles Made Of Sand
Down the street you can hear her scream
You're a disgrace as she slams the door 
in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
and all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries oh girl you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had
Against the door he leans and start a scene
and his tears fall and burn the garden green

And so castles made of sand
fall in the sea
eventually

A little Indian brave who before he was ten
played wargames in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
he would be a fearless warrior Indian chief
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong
until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
and fight his first battle
but something went wrong
surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand
fall in the sea
eventually

There was a young girl
whose heart was a frown
'cause she was crippled for life
and she couldn't speak a sound
and she wished and prayed
she could stop livin'
so she decide to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
and to her legs she smiled
You won't hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way

And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

And so castles made of sand
slips into the sea
eventuallyOne shot all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed
'Til death do us part
Break my heart so I can start

Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this

It's right on time, it's right on time
It's right on time, it's right on time
It's right on time, right on time
Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine, get on 1999

Discard to bombard
Calling all you super stars
[Incomprehensible] bow wow wow
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
So much space to decorate

It's right on time, it's right on time
Right on time, it's right on time
Right on time, it's right on time
Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine, get on 1999

It's right on time, it's right on time
It's right on time, it's right on time

Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row let us go
It's time to blow up for the show

All the world reverberated
Coming through we motorcaded
Vibrate when we operated
Turning up in solid stated, in solid state
I got to solid state, how do you solid state?
Oh LordI like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfuckers always spiked with pain

Looking in my own eyes, hey, Lord
I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose

Looking in my rear view mirror
Looking in my rear view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear, have no fear

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfuckers always spiked with pain

Sitting in my kitchen, hey, girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby, the star of mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me

I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad, sad like me

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain

Just one note could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from the song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay

Just one note could make me choke
One note that's not a lie
Just one note could cut my throat
One note could make me die

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane
Songbird, sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane, it's my Aeroplane

That's spiked with painDusting off your savior

Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater
Now that I can, always my man

Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you could, you make me
All that I am, all in a hand

You better slide you ass over, girl
'Cos I'm coming through once and I'm coming the way you must be...Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world
And all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the east
At least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is that war you're waging

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Everybody's been there
And I don't mean on vacation

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker then the rest there is no test
But this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn

Dream of CalifornicationI got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do

Take it away, I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay

In you a star is born and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm

Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course

This is the way, I wanted it to be with you
This is the way, I knew that it would be with you

Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do

Take it away, I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your lifeStep right up and listen please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Well, well everybody gather 'round
All aboard the underground

You gotta get in before you get out
And getting out is what it's gonna be about
Well, if you find that you are blind
Open up your bashful mind

Let my band step inside
Take you on a cosmic ride
Let my band step inside
Take you on a cosmic ride

With honest sounds, I'll paint your brain
For in this song, I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain

Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip, you'll ride for free
And as we leave our trailer spot
Well outer space is not so dark

This axis bold as love you see
Comes and goes so easily
This axis bold as love you see
Comes and goes so easily

Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus

Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid, you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aww, be my guest inside my grove

'Cause what I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you [Incomprehensible]
Make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm

Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll

Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus

What I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you [Incomprehensible]
Make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm

Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Well take your body, shake it around
And do the dog on the ground

And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have
To make you piss your pants

Space is king or so I sing
A subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus

Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus
Space is king or, or so I sing
Subway to VenusDoes it go from east to west, y'all?
Body free and a body less, y'all
Come again just to start afresh
And once again to find a home

In the moment of the meantime

Dropping in coming through the mesh, y'all
Checking in just to get it blessed, y'all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
And find a form that's free to roam

Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?

Do it all then it all again, y'all
Make it up and you make a friend, y'all
Paddle on just around the bend
And find a place where you can see

All the mamas and the papas

Take a chance on a recommend, y'all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, y'all
Disbelief that I do suspend
And easy now to find a breeze

Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?

We all wanna tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever seen

We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever

I know you said you don't believe
In God, do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave
G L O R I A

Is love my friend, my friend, my friend?

Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G L O R I A

Is love my friend, my friend, my friend?

And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of what I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?
G L O R I A

Is love my friend, my friend, my friend?

I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave
G L O R I A

Is love my friend, my friend, my friend?I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving God

We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is worse
I do not serve in fear of such a curse

Shallow be thy game
2000 years look in the mirror
You play the game of shame
And tell your people live in fear

A rival to the way you see
The bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival
And your control company

You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I'll be your heretic, yeah

You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

To anyone who's listenin'
You're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin

Missionary madness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course, it's fucking rude

To think that you're above
The laws of nature what a joke?
Purple sashes feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke

I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and

You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I'll be your heretic, yeah

You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

Watch it

I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving God

We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is worse
I do not serve in fear of such a

You'll never burn me

I'll be your heretic, yeah

You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybodyI am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home
I don't know what when or why
The twilight of love had arrived

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one elseTime to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move

We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum, kissum, kissum

In the mind is one design to make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a sixty-nine
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Push it on in and pull it on out
I pump that lemon till it pouts

Sex rap, sex
Sex rap, sex

Open your legs to the sensual sound
With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hug the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it, gettin' it, gettin' it good

Sex rap, sex
Sex rap, sex

In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb, I strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum

Well, I like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make cum, make cum, cumDeep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first
Under water where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in the sea just like me

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything

Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my a solar system that fits in your eye microcosm
You could die but you never dead spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head fields of space kid

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything
Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything

Psychic changes are born in your heart entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on salted cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am down with you

Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything
Christ I'm a sidewinder I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh it's everything
