There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more, in my life I love you moreI don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

Tighter
Tighter
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Is just hold me (please), hold me (squeeze), hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You've really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)The Beatles

Here Comes The Sun (Harrison)



Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
and I say it's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
and I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
and I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
and I say it's all right
It's all right(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

There's nothing you can make that can't me made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

All you need is love, all together now
All you need is love, everybody
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need

Nothing to do
To save his life
Call his wife in

Nothing to say
But what a day
How's your boy been?

Nothing to do
It's up to you
I've got nothing to say
But it's O.K.

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, a

Going to work
Don't want to go
Feeling lowdown

Heading for home
You start to roam
Then you're in town

Everybody knows
There's nothing doing
Everything is closed
It's like a ruin

Everyone you see
Is half asleep
And you're on your own
You're in the street

After a while
You start to smile
Now you feel cool

Then you decide
To take a walk
By the old school

Nothing has changed
It's still the same
I've got nothing to say
But it's O.K.

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, a

People running 'round
It's five o'clock
Everywhere in town
It's getting dark

Everyone you see
Is full of life
It's time for tea
And meet the wife

Somebody needs
To know the time
Glad that I'm here

Watching the skirts
You start to flirt
No you're in gear

Go to a show
You hope she goes
I've got nothing to say
But it's O.K.

Good morning, good morning

Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile

So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along

So let me introduce to you the one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Billy ShearsAnna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him

Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves my sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with himWe were talking
About the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves
Behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love, with our love
We could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking
About the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world
And lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see
Are you one of them

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come
When you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without youThe Beatles

Riding on a Bus



Brian Matthew: Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles? 
Paul: We don't think so, really.
Brian: You don't ever think that?
Paul: Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbing about you, which you get often.
John: Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids.
Brian: Now, what do you, eh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
John: No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see.
Brian: Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh--"
Paul: Like riding a bus?
Brian: Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
Paul: Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
John: We go to certain ones.
George: And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us.
Paul: Joe's Café!
Brian: Yeah, that figures.
Paul: Joe's Café! Social statement, that, you know.
George: It is.Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Well I know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
I catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

Na, na, naTell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologise
If you don't really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
Cos I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to meFree as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?

Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird

FreeWell that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah that'll be the day when you make me cry
Ah, you say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well you give me all your loving and all your turtledove-ing
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
You say you love me baby and still you tell me baby
That someday well I'll be through

'Cause that'll be the day when you make me cry
Ah, that'll be the day when you say goodbye
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Yeah that'll be the day when you make me cry
Ah, you say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die

Well when Cupid shot his dart, he shot it at your heart
So if we'll ever part and I'll leave too
And you say you'll call me and you tell me boldly
That some day well I'll be through

'Cause that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah that'll be the day when you make me cry
Ah, you say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
