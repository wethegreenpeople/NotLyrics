I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Catholic choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Catholic choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Catholic choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the worldYour skin, your skin

Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And all the things you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along, I wrote a song for you
And everything you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to 've done
And it was all yellow

And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Don't you know?
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across, I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Coz you were all yellow

I drew a line, I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do, my love
And it was all yellow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
Do you know?
For you I bleed myself dry
For you I bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you doThe lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are
You are
You are
You are

You are
You are

And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to goIn my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you pay for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
Oh for it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I'll wait for it
If you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you

(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you pay for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
Oh for it

Singing ooh, ooh
Please, please, please
Come back and sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me
Come back and sing

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost oh yeah
Oh yeahWhen you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix youCome up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oohWhere do we go, nobody knows
I've gotta say, I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
And put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line
I've gotta say, I wasted all your time, oh honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon my face, yeah

Now when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I want it too
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go, nobody knows
Don't ever say, you're on your way down, when
God gave you style and gave you grace
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

Now when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I want it too
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine

Where do we go, nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down, when
God gave you style and gave you grace
God put a smile upon your faceHoney you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you
And how could
Anybody deny you?

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter now I've met you
An' honey you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

The green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who
Tried to deny you must be out of their minds

'Cause I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you
Honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you

Green eyes, green eyes
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I standCome here, oh, my star is fading
I swerved out of control
And if I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

Come here, oh, my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I know if I only waited
When will I get out of this hole

And time is on your side, it's on your side now
I'm pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern

So come here, oh, my star is fading
I swerved just out of reach
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I'm screaming underneath

And time is on your side, it's on your side now
I'm pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
I'm on my way back down again
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach

Say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of our secrets

Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
Oh, you came along and you cut me loose
Oh, you came along and you cut me loose
Oh, you came along and you cut me looseWas a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow
White snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below

When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God

Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft

Bury me in honor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
A love back home it unfolds

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to violet hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me,
Won't you let me know?Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

Time is so short and I'm sure
There must be something more

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close

You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven but you, oh, oh, oh, oh

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living my head, ohI wanna be bigger, stronger*
 Drive a faster car
 To take me anywhere in seconds
 To take me anywhere I wanna go
 And drive around a faster car

 I will settle for nothing less
 I will settle for nothing less

 I wanna be bigger, stronger
 Drive a faster car
 At the touch of a button
 I can go anywhere I wanna go
 And drive around my faster car

 I will settle for nothing less
 I will settle for nothing less

 I think I wanna change my attitude
 I think I wanna change my attitude
 I think I wanna change my ah, my atmosphere
 I wanna be strong

 I wanna be bigger, stronger
 Drive a faster car
 To take me anywhere in seconds
 To take me anywhere I wanna go
 And drive around my faster car

 I will settle for nothing less
 I will settle for nothing less

 I think I need to change my attitude
 I think I wanna change my attitude
 I think I wanna change my ah, my atmosphere
 I wanna be strong

 Bigger and better
 Bigger and better
 Bigger and better
 Bigger and better

 Bigger, stronger
 Drive a faster car
 At the touch of a button
 I can go anywhere I wanna goMy song is love
Love to the lovely song
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone

Your heavy heart is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're a target that I'm aiming at
And I get that message home

My song is love, my song is love, unknown
And I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're a target that I'm aiming at
But I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late, oh
On a platform, I'm gonna stand and then say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message homeThey were sitting, they were sitting in the strawberry swing
And every moment was so precious
They were sitting, they were talking in the strawberry swing
And everybody was for fighting, wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water what you say?
It's such, it's such a perfect day, it's such a perfect day

I remember we were walking pp to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning, wouldn't wanna change a thing
People moving all the time inside a perfect straight line
Don't you wanna curve away?
It's such it's such a perfect day, it's such a perfect day

Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

The sky could be blue, could be gray
Without you I just slide away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of timeDarling those tired eyes
Go with me all the time
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine

Were do you go to pretty baby?
Where do you go to when the night winds away?
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do?
Who do I sing for? Well honey I sing about you, youA warnin' sign
I missed the good part, then I realized
I started lookin', and the bubble burst
I started lookin' for excuses

Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started lookin' for a warnin' sign

When the truth is, I miss you
Yeah, the truth is, that I miss you so

A warnin' sign
It came back to haunt me, and I realized
That you were an island, and I passed you by
And you were an island, to discover

Come on in
I've gotta tell you, what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started lookin' for a warnin' sign, yeah

When the truth is, I miss you
Yeah, the truth is, that I miss you so
And I'm tired, I should not have let you go

So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open armsOh no I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no what's this?
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turn to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I never meant to cause you trouble
And I never meant to do you wrong
And I well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
The spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here I'm, am I in my little bubble

Singing and oh, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I never meant to do you wrong
And I well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for meAnd the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
It is sweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
You really broke my heart

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
That was the hardest part

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
Your silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh and it's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest partYour skin, your skin
Oh, oh

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And everything you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

And your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful

Don't you know?
You know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cuz you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do, my love
And it was all yellow
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And your skin
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful

Do you know?
For you I bleed myself dry
For you I bleed myself trying

It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for

Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you doYou're in control, is there anywhere you wanna go?
You're in control, is there anything you wanna know?
The future's for discovering, the space in which we're traveling

From the top of the first page to the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface, trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

First line of the first page to the end of the last place
You were looking from the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter who you are

You just want somebody listening to what you say
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too?
Are they bleeding all your colors into one?
And if you come undone as if you'd been run through
Some catapult that fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come or if you're stuck in square oneAll winter we got carried away
Over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry

So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

Try
Try

Try
Try

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want to cycle or recycle revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want to cycle or recycle revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

And in the end
We lie awake and we dream of making our escape
And in the end
We lie awake and we dream of making our escapeWhat if there was no light?
Nothin' wrong, nothin' right
What if there was no time
And no reason or rhyme?

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life?

What if I got it wrong?
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life?

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life
That you don't want me there by your side?

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Ooh, that's right

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Ooh, that's right[Instrumental]In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost
Oh yeah

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost
Oh yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it

I was scared
I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I'll wait for it

And if you go, if you go
And leave me down
Here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it, yeah

Sing it please, please, please
Come back and sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me

Come back and sing
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah, oh yeahWhen it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Saying, "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Since they've gone

If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let it go
If there's any screaming let the windows down
As I crawl to the ground

If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness
