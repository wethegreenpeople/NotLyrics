CHORUS 

(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) {x2}Until the end of time, I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look in a word, you were sexy
All of my cool attitude you took my body was next

You made love to me, like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me? Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy? That's why

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define, just what you mean to me

When we be makin' love, I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other, they know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby

They know this is serious, this ain't just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial
You could say that, I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride
Well maybe not the ride, but I got to have your face, all up in the place

I'd like to think that, I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' can compare
To your lovely face, do you know what I'm sayin' to you?

I'm just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you

Can I talk to you? Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander, I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things that I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother, more than your brother

I wanna be like no other, if you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me, without you there is no sea there is no shore

Love is too weak to define how much I adore you
The last words you hear

Be with me darlin' till the end of all time
I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body, I'll give you my time
For all time, I am with you, you are with meThis will be the day that you will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for you, love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right if we always fight?
Why can't we just let love decide?
Am I the weaker man because I understand
That love must be the master plan?

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love

D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time, love will blow your mind
And everything you'll look for you'll find
That will be the time, that everything will shine
So bright it makes you colorblind

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be, would you, would you be happy little baby?Oh, ooh

Wherever u go, whatever u do
Oh, please, remember that I'll always be there for you
You don't have to call, you don't have to say
Just think about me and I'll be on my way

I don't have to worry, I'm sure you'll be fine
'Cuz if you stay happy, then what's your's is mine
Wherever u go, whatever u do
Remember that I'll always be there for you
Oh, baby

Wherever you are, think of your dreams
Oh, please, remember life ain't always what it seems
For each rainy day that comes your way
The sun will come shining and you'll be okay

Keep on smiling, every girl and boy
Remember when you were children you had toys
Wherever you are, think of your dreams
Remember that dreams become the life you lead

Whatever you play, it's okay to lose
Ooh, sometimes, long as you learn from every game you choose
If one thing is sure, you'll always endure
If you try your best at everything you do

Say what you mean and mean what you say
The price for a broken heart's to much to pay
And nothing is worth it, if you don't have to try
The higher the stakes, the higher the sky

Wherever u go, whatever u do
Please remember, remember that I'll always be there for youPrince

A long time ago, you took six months a walkin'
Talkin' on the other side
What started as an experiment turned into a heaven-sent
Message that saved your ass from dyin'

Somebody said, "In life there's always peaks and valleys
And if you're lost they won't show you the way"
That same somebody said, "I'd dig u better dead
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say"

And with the awesome power they struck
First they offered up the buck
Right in the middle, right in the middle they stuck
A toke or two, what the fuck?

One minute you're hot
Tell the truth and you're not
That's the noose that they hang
On a goose like you

Somebody said, "In life there's always peaks and valleys
And if you're lost they won't show you the way"
That same somebody said, "I'd dig u better dead
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say"

Dig u better dead, I'd dig u better dead
Dig u better dead, I'd dig u better dead
Dig u better dead, I'd dig u better dead
Dig u better dead, I'd dig u better dead

And whatever you do, don't make somebody happy
Don't dress too freaky and make their daughters stare
Then you'll find out how deep the valley truly be
If you plan on catchin' the bus, you better have plenty fare

Somebody said, "In life there's always peaks and valleys
And if you're lost they won't show you the way"
That same somebody said, "I'd dig u better dead
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say"

This Is My House
Fellow earthlings, please tell me this 
What planet will our children live on if we choose 2 ruin this one? 
This is my house 
This is my future 
This is my song 
Now bust it 

The world is dying from the outside in 
All of us livin' like a preacher livin' in sin 
Trash on trash taller than a mile 
When we're all livin' under it, there won't be nary a smile 

CHORUS: 
Hey, this is my house, this is my future 
My will be done 
Hey, this is my house, this is my future 
My children's kingdom come 

Your filthy water, don't pour it here 
Don't wanna drink, don't want the fear 
The air I'm breathing, it makes me cough 
Your hot reactor is going off (going off) 
And I say ... 

CHORUS 

Stop building bombs and take that money 
2 build a school, huh, and teach the honeys 
About this planet Earth and why we need 
2 take care of this land so there's food 2 feed 
All the babies so they grow big and strong 
This is my house and this is my song 

CHORUS 

And the choir sing: 
This is my house 
This is my kingdom come 
This is my house 
My future (future) (future) 

(My house) {repeat 2 fade in BG} 
This is my house 
This is my future 
This is my song

I was working part time in a five and dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close too nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I, think I, I think I love her

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I lovePrince

All the time world wide

Want you to understand somethin' asta

Come me say, love, me say unto another
Watcha them attack each and every vulture
Or do you wants forget that P-R-O starts via pro
Teachin' things in life you'll never know

What for they dabble they don't understandsa
They caught me comin' from the other Minnesota
My flava will burn their earsa
Awhen it comes to music this sir is no stranger

Is the same kids you compliment
The same ones that you were meant
To rob an education from
In a private school as opposed to one

That yearly spits out another group of fools
Into a system designed to fail
Wait a minute, I just got some e-mail
Somebody selling twelve CDs for a dollar
Make me wanna holler
Alright to the maximum

I don't need you to tell me what clothes to wear
I don't want suggestions about my hair
If the whole world buys your bullshit I don't f'in care
I'd rather put on something that world wouldn't dare 'cause

NPG in the original pro nation
Hear me though

Yeah, make some noise if you're ready, NPG rocks the city
Rugged and raw lift up your bra, show me your titties
Don't be a dumb, son, grab your condoms and Bacardi
Here's car keys, let's party

You fake players walkin' streets in mean mug
I be makin' records gettin' in the hot tub
In this Minneapolis snow I'm fellin'
Ready set to blow up like Mt. Saint Helen

On your cord snorin' your flow borin'
Sort of like channel 5 at 4 in the mornin'
Adult [Incomprehensible] give up hope
Grab the Devil by the throat, make him play the scapegoat

In the runnin' with the bucket of cuttin's
Wishin' I had duckets to live like Kirby Puckett
Here comes the rumors I'm down with NPG
I sign the contract, I'm doing the LP

But woe, what a minute bro' go slow
Ten dollars for the blow, no dollars for the ho'
In the club trick holdin'
Lookin' for a black magic woman
Gang strong with dick holdin'

I rock, therefore I am
