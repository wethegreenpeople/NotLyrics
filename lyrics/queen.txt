A Kind Of Magic
A Kind Of Magic
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One shaft of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a mind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
It's a challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
It's a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be will soon be,
Will soon be gone,
This is a kind of magic,
Tere can only be one,
This life that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be gone,
Magic - it's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
It's magic,
It's a kind of magic.Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy

Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time

Goodbye everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

Mama, ooh
(Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
(Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro)
Magnifico

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
Will not let you go!
(Let me go!)
(Never never never never let me go!)
Will not let you go!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blowsQueen

Friends Will Be Friends
Another red letter day,
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating,
The other half ran away,
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber,
Got a pain in the chest,
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest.

It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.

Now it's a beautiful day,
The postman delivered a letter from your lover,
Only a phone call away,
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number,
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life without him in your way.

It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.

It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,

Friends will be friends,

Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos right till the end -
Friends will be friends.Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shinin' we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show

Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find, I still love you

You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game

No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

These are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but somethings remain
When I look and I find, no change

Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you, I still love youQueen

Look what they've done to my dream.

Fried chickenThere's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one
Sweet moment set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

Who dares to love forever?
When love must die

Then touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your finger tips
And we can have forever and we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -
On with the show -
The show must go on...Fear me you lords and lady preachers

I Want It All
Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out,
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me)
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

Hammer To Fall
Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

CHORUS
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way --
Build your muscles as your body decays

CHORUS
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
Then it's time for the Hammer to Fall

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Oh no, oh no
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Oh no
Baby now your struggle's all vain

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder

CHORUS
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to hammer to fall
Waiting for the Hammer to hammer to hammer to fallPressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming get me out
Tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

Day day day
Okay

Chippin' around
Kick my brains round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours

People on streets
People on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Tomorrow takes me high, high, higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

Turned away from it all
Like the blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?

Love, love, love, love

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love give love give love?

Give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For the people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves

This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves

Killer Queen
She keeps Moet et Chandon 
In her pretty cabinet 
'Let them eat cake' she says 
Just like Marie Antoinette 
A built-in remedy 
For Kruschev and Kennedy 
At anytime an invitation 
You can't decline 

Caviar and cigarettes 
Well versed in etiquette 
Extraordinarily nice 
Chorus

She's a Killer Queen 
Gunpowder, gelatine 
Dynamite with a laser beam 
Guaranteed to blow your mind 
Anytime 

Recommended at the price 
Insatiable an appetite 
Wanna try? 

To avoid complications 
She never kept the same address 
In conversation 
She spoke just like a baroness 
Met a man from China 
Went down to Asia Minor
Then again incidentally 
If you're that way inclined 

Perfume came naturally from Paris 
For cars she couldn't care less 
Fastidious and precise 
Chorus

Drop of a hat she's as willing as 
Playful as a pussy cat 
Then momentarily out of action 
Temporarily out of gas 
To absolutely drive you wild, wild 
She's all out to get you

You love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door

Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to break free
Oh, how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to
Living without, living without
Living without you, by my side

I don't want to live alone, yeah
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see? Yeah

God knows I want to
God knows I want to
God knows I want to break freeIt started off so well
They said, "We made a perfect pair"
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried?

The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years be lie, we lived a lie
I'll love you until' I die

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted all that love?

I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I'll love you until' I die

Save me, save me, save me
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from homeYou suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money - you still want more, 

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow - minded cronies who are fools of the first division- 

Death on two legs -
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heard of your own -

Kill joy, Bad guy,
Big talking, Small fry
You're just an old barrow - boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me -

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good, are you satisfied

Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night,
Do you feel good - Feel good!

Talk like a big business tycoon,
But you're just a hot - air balloon,
So no one gives you a damn,
You're just an overgrown school - boy
Let me tan your hide.

A dog with disease,
King of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know all,
Was the fin on your back part of the deal...(shark!)

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs -
You never had a heart of your own,
(You never did, right from the start)

Insane you should be put inside,
You're a sewer - rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null - and - void,
Make me feel good
I feel good.Queen
A Night At The Opera
Good Company
Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B.
He dangled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all Good Company

Oo Hoo Oo Hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep Good Company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day and Sally J.
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her won't you
Keep me Company

Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door.

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited Company

I hardly noticed Sally as we
Parted Company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me

Now I'm old I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see

I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And Keep Good Company

And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
There's nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight - you're rushin' [... etc.]
