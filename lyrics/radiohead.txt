Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

And fade out again
And fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in loveRed wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get back where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next lifeThe morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Yeah

Release me
Release me

Where'd you park your car?
Where'd you park the car?
The clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well

Sleepy jack, the fire drill
Round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
Round

In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again

In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universePlease could you stop the noise? I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head

What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)

When I am king you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all

What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking and squealing, Gucci little piggy

You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name? I guess he does

Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height

Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height

 (Rain down)
That's it, sir, you're leaving
The crackle of pigskin
(Rain down, come on, rain down on me)
The dust and the screaming
The yuppies networking

The panic, the vomit
(From a great height)
The panic, the vomit
(From a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah!A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

You look so tired unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us

I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit
My final bellyache

With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please

Such a pretty houses
And such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises

He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

Arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

This is what you'll get

It's not enough

How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You used to reel me out and then you cut the string

You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone

One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright
What happened?
Et cetera, et cetera

Facts for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a shear drop

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the stringIt barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin'
No one else would know

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow downWho's in a bunker?

Until I burst

Disavow the pleasure

You were not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak his name
Dedicated to all you, all your needs

Because we separate
It ripples our reflections
Because we separate
It ripples our reflections

Reckoner
Dedicated to all you, all your needsWas always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
To take a holiday

Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no one's listening anyway
Just trying to bribe me

And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

Today I wrote a bad check
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no one's looking anyway
I hope you miss me

Motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing

The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes it's so so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I am gonna to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground

You know, you know where you are with

Floor collapsing, floating
Bouncing back and

Wakey, wakey, rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall like dominos
In pretty patterns

Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling, tingling, tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to, what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuck, stuck, stuck
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no, for no real reason

Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
And take a bow, take a bow, take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to, what you ought to

An elephant that's in the room
Is tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and plastic bags
And duplicate and triplicate

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuck, stuck, stuck
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no

Exactly where do you get off
Is enough, is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough
A last stop, there's no real reason

You got a head full of feathers
You got melted to butterIn the next world war, jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again

In the neon sign scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again

In a fast German car, I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

That's not me
I go
Where I please

I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah it's gone
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not hereJust as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favorite song

As your blather disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back and focus again

The walls abandon shape
You've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission

Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round

I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
What's the point of instruments
Words are a sawed off shotgun

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Jigsaw falling into place
There is nothing to explain
Regard each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once, not just twice

Wish away nightmare, wish away nightmare
You got a light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Jigsaw falling into placeI'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car

I am all the days
That you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong, it's all right
It's all wrong, it's all right
It's all wrong, it's all right
It's all wrong, it's all right
It's all, it's allI'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change

Kill me Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the air crash
Pull me out of the lake
â€~Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day!
I feel my luck could change

Pull me out of the air crash
Pull me out of the lake
â€~Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

We are standing on the edgeSo, so you think you can tell heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year running over the same old ground
What have you found? The same old fears wish you were hereThere's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin

And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
(4, 5, 6, 7)

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down

I can watch and not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you aliveIn the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me

Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me

Turn me on to phantom
I follow to the edge
Of the earth
And fall off

Yeah, everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes

Weird fishes
Weird fishes

Yeah I, I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

I, I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
EscapeI am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see your reflection

It's always best when the choir is out
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

And either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind

So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

And either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the wallsI want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon this surface for the birds
The birds, the birds

You want me?
Fucking well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches

And nothing
Nothing
Nothing

Nothing

You want me?
Well come on and break the door down
You want me?
Fucking come on and break the door down

I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready

I'm ready
I'm ready
