We'll do it all
Everything
On our own

We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
They're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
Will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?I'm trying not to stare, it's too late
The blankets over there, if you like
I'm broken and I'm colder than hell
I should've said I'd not come back here

Your breakfast will get cold
I really have to go

It's easier to lie and be safe
Time and time again, I'm half stalled
One giant leap of faith is easy
When everyone you ask is so sure

Just give a second thought
What if we don't get caught?

Just say you love me now
And forget this whole row
Just save your energy
For making up with meShut your eyes and think of somewhere
Somewhere cold and caked in snow
By the fire, we break the quiet
Learn to wear each other well

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
You're our secret space at will

Shut your eyes, I spin the big chair
And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
You're our secret space at will

Shut your eyes
Shut your eyes
Shut your eyes
Shut your eyes

Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)
Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)

Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)
Shut your eyes and sing to me
(Shut your eyes and sing to me)I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms and state lines
The distance from here to where you'd be
It's only finger-lengths that I see

I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers increases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science

Their word's mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have traveled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids

And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

I'm miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm armsI won't leave you out of my will
But I will leave you out of my mind for now
I won't be there to break your sweet heart
But not being there might break your sweet heart

You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy

If I could cradle you into my arms
I would cradle you tight in my arms always
So don't be scared of all those hurtful words
'Cause in the end they'll hurt themselves much more

You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy

You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joy
You are my joy, you are my joyOne step too far
Is not far enough away from here
Stay close to me
Don't relax your grip on my right hand

But you are all I really want in this life
You could be the summer rain on my face
You push a little tear into my eye lid
Don't torture yourself thinking that it must sting

Don't turn your head
Pretend they're all dead and gone by now
Can you feel that?
Feels like breath on the back of my neck

But you are all I really want in this life
You could be the summer rain on my face
You push a little tear into my eye lid
Don't torture yourself thinking that it must stingI'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes
I nearly do

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Slower, slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is to find an easier way
To get out of our little heads

Have heart, my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dearYou cool your bed-warm hands down
On the broken radiator
And when you lay them freezing on me
I mumble, "Can you wake me later?"

But I don't really want you to stop
And you know it so it doesn't stop you
And run your hands from my neck to my chest

Crack the shutters open wide
I wanna bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body

I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you

It's been minutes, it's been days
It's been all I will remember
Happy lost in your hair
And the cold side of the pillow

Your hills and valleys
Are mapped by my intrepid fingers
And in a naked slumber
I dream all this again

Crack the shutters open wide
I wanna bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body

I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you

Crack the shutters open wide
I wanna bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body

I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want youI choked back tears today
'Cause I can't begin to say
How much you've shaped this boy
These last ten years or more

My friends, we've seen it all
Triumphs to drunken falls
And our bones are broken still
But our hearts are joined until

Time slips its tired hand
Into our tired hands
We've years 'til that day
And so much more to say

You give the strength to me
A strength I never had
I was a mess, you see
I'd lost the plot so bad

You dragged me up and out
Out of the darkest place
There's not a single doubt
When I can see your faces

My friends, we've seen it all
When it made no sense at all
You dare to light my path
And found the beauty in the aftermath

Let me hold you up
Like you held me up
It's too long to never say this
You must know I've always thought

You give the strength to me
A strength I never had
I was a mess, you see
I'd lost the plot so bad

You dragged me up and out
Out of the darkest place
There's not a single doubt
When I can see your faces

You give the strength to me
A strength I never had
I was a mess, you see
I'd lost the plot so bad

You dragged me up and out
Out of the darkest place
There's not a single doubt
When I can see your facesI'm running out of ways to make you see
I want you to stay here beside me
I won't be okay and I won't pretend I am
So just tell me today and take my hand

Please take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test
Nor a trick of the mind, only love

It's so simple and you know it is, you know it is
We can't be to and fro like this all our lives
You're the only way to me, the path is clear
What do I have to say to you for God's sake, dear?

For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test
Nor a trick of the mind, only love

Just say yes
'Cause I'm aching and I know you are too
For the touch
Of your warm skin as I breathe you in

I can feel your heart beat through my shirt
This was all I wanted, all I want

It's all I want
It's all I want
It's all I want
It's all I want

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test
Nor a trick of the mind, only love

Just say yes
'Cause I'm aching and I know you are too
For the touch
Of your warm skin as I breathe you inThe winter's marked the earth
It's floored was frozen glass
You slip into my arms
And you quickly correct yourself

Your freezing speech bubbles
Seem to hold your words aloft
I want the smoky clouds of laughter
To swim about me forever more

I will race you to the waterside
And from the edge of Ireland shout out loud
So they could hear it in America
It's all for you

The shells crack under our shoes
Like punctuation points
The planets bend between us
A hundred million suns and stars

The sea filled in the silence
Before you sank those words
And now even in the darkness
I can see how happy you are

I will race you to the waterside
And from the edge of Ireland shout out loud
So they could hear it in America
It's all for you, it's all for you
It's all for you, it's all for you
It's all for youChased by I don't know what

And I'll come running for my life
Scramble through these greasy pathways
I can't look up for fear of forwards
I hear your words reverberate

An easy ride is all you said I was

Please try to control your feelings
It doesn't make me want you more
I'm terrified by every vacant
Glance you shoot across my wayTrain this chaos, turn it into light
I've gotta see you one last night
Before the lions take their share
Leave us in pieces scattered everywhere

Just give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear â€~cause you are all that I have
It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear â€~cause you are all that I have

You're cinematic razor sharp
A welcome arrow through the heart
Under your skin feels like home
Electric shocks on aching bones

Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear â€~cause you are all that I have
It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear â€~cause you are all that I have

There is a darkness deep in you
A frightening magic I cling to

Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Give me a chance to hold on
Just give me something to hold onto

It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear now you are all that I have
It's so clear now that you are all that I have
I have no fear now you are all that I havePlease, don't let this turn into something it's not
I can only give you everything, I've got
I can't be as sorry, as you think I should
But I still love you more than anyone else could

All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time, that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you told me to look past everything
I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

We have got through so much worse than this before
What's so different this time that you can't ignore
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
Th first kiss and the first time, that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you told me to look past everything
I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
The first kiss and the first time, that I felt connected to anything
The weight of water, the way you told me to look past everything
I have ever learned
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was love

And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please, just save me from this darkness
Please, just save me from this darkness

And I don't know where to look
My words just break and melt
Please, just save me from this darkness
Please, just save me from this darknessAll this feels strange and untrue
And I won't waste a minute without you
My bones ache, my skin feels cold
And I'm getting so tired and so old

The anger swells in my guts
And I won't feel these slices and cuts
I want so much to open your eyes
'Cos I need you to look into mine

Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

Get up, get out, get away from these liars
'Cos they don't get your soul or your fire
Take my hand, knot your fingers through mine
And we'll walk from this dark room for the last time

Every minute from this minute now
We can do what we like anywhere
I want so much to open your eyes
'Cos I need you to look into mine

Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

All this feels strange and untrue
And I won't waste a minute without youThe earth is warm, next to my ear
Insects noise is all that I hear
A magic trick makes the world disappear
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear

A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
The snow and ticker tape blurs all my senses numb
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch

Cold water, cleaning my wounds
A side parade with a single balloon
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
Blue as seas, running to them

I feel like I am watching everything from space
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could wantI want something
That's purer than the water
Like we were

It's not there now
Ineloquence and anger
Are all we have

Like Saturn's rings
An icy loop around me
Too hard to hold

Lash out first
At all the things we don't like
Or understand

And it's beginning to get to me
That I know more of the stars and sea
Than I do of what's in your head
Barely touching in our cold bed

Are you beginning to get my point
They're always fighting with aching joints
It's doing nothing but tire us out
No one knows what this fight's about

The answer phone
The lonely sound of your voice
Frozen in time

I only need
The compass that you gave me
To guide me on

And it's beginning to get to me
That I know more of the stars and sea
Than I do of what's in your head
Barely touching in our cold bed

Are you beginning to get my point
They're always fighting with aching joints
It's doing nothing but tire us out
And no one knows what this fight's about

It's so thrilling but also wrong
Don't have to prove that you are so strong
'Cause I can carry you on my back
After our enemies attack

I tried to tell you before I left
But I was screaming under my breath
You are the only thing that makes sense
Just ignore all this present tense

We need to feel breathless with love
And not collapse under its weight
I'm gasping for the air to fill
My lungs with everything I've lost

We need to feel breathless with love
And not collapse under its weight
I'm gasping for the air to fill
My lungs with everything I've lostYou could be happy
And I won't know
But you weren't happy
The day I watched you go

And all the things
That I wished I had not said
Are played on loops
Till it's madness in my head

Is it too late to remind you
How we were
But not our last days of silence
Screaming, blur

Most of what I remember
Makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking
Out the door

You could be happy
I hope you are
You made me happier
Than I'd been by far

Somehow everything
I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment
It's all not true

Do the things
That you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back
Don't think, just do

More than anything
I want to see you go
Take a glorious bite
Out of the whole worldWe'll do it all
Everything
On our own

We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?I broke into your house last night
And left a note at your bedside
I'm far too shy to speak to you at school
You leave me numb and I'm not sure why

I find it easier to sit and stare
Than push my limbs out towards you right there
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies

I struggle for the words and then give up
My heads up with the birds on the T-hut
A little piece of mind that I know better
That the plain disgrace of all my letters

But after that the floodgates opened up
And I fell in love with everyone I saw
Please take your time I'm not in any rush
And it's in everything I ever write

It's not as if I need the extra weight
Confused enough by life so thanks a lot
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me

I struggle for the words and then give up
My heads up with the birds in the T-hut
A little piece of mind that I know better
That the plain disgrace of all my lettersIt's hard to argue when
You won't stop making sense
But my tongue still misbehaves
And it keeps digging my own grave

With my hands open and my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

Why would I sabotage
The best thing that I have?
Well, it makes it easier to know
Exactly what I want

With my hands open and my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

Put Sufjan Stevens on
And we'll play your favorite song
'Chicago' bursts to life
And your sweet smile remembers you

My hands open and my eyes open
I just keep hoping
That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

It's not as easy as willing it all to be right
Gotta be more than hoping it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joySworn to secrecy, I might go after school
She was an angel, I saw her swimming there
I am in such a mess I can't cope with this
She just teases me, pretends she can't see me here

So let me go up there I can be fresh air
Stay with you all night, just let me love you
Just for a while or two
Be with you all night be with you all night

Till I fall asleep, till I fall asleep
Till I fall asleep, till I fall asleep
Just let me be here, I won't tell anyone
Don't wanna wake up, don't wanna wake up

The blind lead the blind, so I can't help find my way
This could be heaven I don't know where I am
I am too scared to come out from behind here
My body is aching it feels like it's wearing me

So let me go up there, I can be fresh air
Stay with you all night, just let me love you
Just for a while or two
Be with you all night, be with you all night

Till I fall asleep, till I fall asleep
Till I fall asleep, till I fall asleep
Just let me be here, I won't tell anyone
Don't wanna wake up, don't wanna wake upFor once I want to be the car crash
Not always just the traffic jam
Hit me hard enough to wake me
And lead me wild to your dark roads

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear

My tongue is lost so I can't tell you
Please just see it in my eyes
I pull up thorns from our ripped bodies
And let the blood fall in my mouth

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fearWe do not have the lyrics for It's All Gone Quiet yet.I couldn't believe what I was seeing
Faces all screwed up like what I'd done
I didn't mean to hurt you so much
I knew it would hurt you but not like this

We all make a mess from time to time, dear
It'll take me a lifetime to get this cleared
Somebody muttered something under their breath
I let on like I was a little deaf

Nobody's perfect that's what I say
No one has hurt me so much, you say
I'm sorry

Running away seemed like the easy
Thing to do because I wanted time
To put a smile back on my dear face
For once nothing's missing and I feel fine

I was afraid to tell you some things
But some things all find a way to get told
Hearing it from the lips of somebody else
Must have knocked the wind out of your sweet chest

Nobody's perfect that's what I say
No one has hurt me so much, you say
I'm sorry

Nobody's perfect that's what I say
And no one has hurt me so much, you say
I'm sorry
