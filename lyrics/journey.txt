Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin', hold on to the feelin', streetlight people
Don't stop believin', hold on, streetlight people
Don't stop believin', hold on to the feelin', streetlight peopleHighway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love along the wire

They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me, I'm forever yours faithfully

Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time always another show
Wondering where I am lost without you

And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me, I'm forever yours faithfully

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh
Faithfully, I'm still yours
I'm forever yours, ever yours faithfullyHighway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go 'round and 'round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love along the wire

They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl you stand by me, I'm forever yours, faithfully

Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wondering where I am lost without you

And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh girl, you stand by me, I'm forever yours, faithfully

Faithfully, I'm still yours
I'm forever yours, ever yours
Faithfully[Instrumental:]When the lights go down in the City

Trial By Fire
Castles Burning
Jimmy wanted her the moment that she stumbled his way
With a cocktail in her hand, she knew how she'd win the game
They were beautfiul in all the right places
She kept her rendezvous with soap opera faces
She started rumours that were driving him crazy
He couldn't stop the things they'd say

And they live for, passion, love and pain
In a rage of jealousy and fame
And they watch their dreams go up in flames

Castles burning... in the dead of night
Castles burning... in the dead of night
Whoa... burnin'.. burnin' burnin'...

In the kingdom of pretenders love is not what it seems
Jimmy cried and then he punished her 
No one heard her scream
On the outsdie, it's all crimson and clover
On the inside, they know it's over
And the band of lawyers that steal the show
As they watch their world go up in smoke

Castles burning... in the dead of night
Castles burning... in the dead of night
Whoa... burnin'..
Burnin'.. burnin'.. burnin'.. burnin'..

When we return a story of a 5 alarm fire
late last night in the prestigious 
Hollywood Hills, where one of the most
controversial marriages in the
entertainment industry went up in smoke, 
arson is suspected, 
it is still under investigation...

You know I love you, you know you're my girl
I'd never hurt you... no...

Castles burning... in the dead of night
Castles burning... in the dead of night
Castles burning... in the dead of night
Castles burning... in the dead of night, burnin', burnin'

Castles burnin'.. you know I love you baby, 
You know you're my girl

All is fair in love and war, but war is hell...
In the heat of the night, in the middle of the big bad cityA faded wedding photograph.
You and me in our first dance.
Our eyes are closed.
We're lost in one sweet embrace.

Since those days the world has changed.
But our love remains the same.
God knows we've had our share of saving grace.

And I'm proud of all the blessings you have given me.
The mountains we have climbed to get this far.
We've learned to take the laughter with the tears.
After all these years.

You make it feel brand new.
After the fires that we walked through.
Against the odds we never lost our faith.

In a house we made our home.
Where our children all have grown
Precious moments time cannot erase.

Make a living up and down the gypsy highways.
The seasons that we had to share apart.
Somehow in my heart I always keep you near.
After all these years.

After all these years.
You stood by me the days and nights that I was gone.
After all these years.
You sacrificed, believed in me, and you stood strong.
Cause with our love there's nothing left to fear.
After all these years.

After all these years.
You stood by me the days and nights that I was gone.
After all these years.
You sacrificed, believed in me, and you stood strong.
Cause with our love there's nothing left to fear.
After all these years.Journey
Trial By Fire
Trial By Fire
Treasures in the jars clay
Let the Light shine out of Darkness
Fallen down but not destroyed
It's just another trial by fire

In my song I'll send a prayer
Do you know me, do you hear me
Where the will to face this shame
It's just another trial by fire

Hello Mr. Moon
Can I have some time with you
Trouble keep me runnin'...
You can see it comin'...
I know who shines down on you

Hellow Mr. Moon
I've come back to talk to you
All my life I'm runnin'...
>From the love that's comin'
Saving grace please pull me through

In my doubt I can't beliece
Like a wave tossed where the wind blows
Tears of faith temper my soul
Just another trial by fire
Just another trial by fireHere we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights, losing ground
I'm reachin' for you, you, you

Feelin' that it's gone
Can change your mind
If we can't go on
To survive the tide love divides

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, vain

If you must go, I wish you love
You'll never walk alone
Take care my love
Miss you love

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you

I still love you girl
I really love you girl
And if he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
No, noYou make me weep and wanna die
Just when you said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other

When I'm alone all by myself
You're out with someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other

You're tearin' me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh, what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart

It won't be long, yes till you're alone
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home
'Cause he's lovin', ooo, he's touchin'
He's squeezin' another

He's tearin' you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh, girl what can you say?
'Cause he's lovin', touchin' another

Now it's your turn, girl to cry
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na naIn this promised land
Fire burnin' in our hands
The choice is ours to make
Realize your fantasy

You live the dream
With every step you take
Stand tall stand on the edge
Use the thin end of the wedge

The will to cast your fate
Don't turn around too late
Lose ground if we hesitate
Burning youth won't wait

Make a move across the Rubicon
Future's knockin' at your door
Take your time and choose the road you want
Opportunity is yours

See it all so clear
Time is right time is near
We know now what to do
All God's children learn which way to turn

Turning back we're through
We all refuse to lose
Live life and light the fuse
Burning youth won't waitIt was just the month of May
Words got in my way, girl, I'm so sorry
So I'm reaching out
With hope to see you through
Just another day

Do you see the words I'm tryin' to say?
But words get in my way, girl, I really mean it
Yes, I warned you from the start
That I could break your heart
So girl don't stay

Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl

I'm the fool that plays the part
The one that broke your heart
Girl, I'm so sorry
So what more can a poor boy do
I'm reaching out to you so now don't you stay

Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl

Shades turn red from green to blue
What more can I do, I told you this before
So please walk out that door
I told you from the start that love could break your heart
Girl, I'm so sorry

Ooh little girl
Ooh little girl
Ooh little girlLying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heart with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

We sailed on together, we drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms

Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back
Turned night into day, I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open armsIt's been so long, since I've seen her face
You say she's doin' fine
I still recall a sad cafe
How it hurt so bad to see her cry
I didn't wanna say goodbye

Send her my love, memories remain
Send her my love, roses never fade
Send her my love

The same hotel, the same old room
Journey's on the road again
She needed so much more, than I could give
We knew our love could not pretend
Broken hearts can always mend

Send her my love, memories remain
Send her my love, roses never fade
Send her my love

Callin' out her name, I'm dreamin'
Reflections of a face I'm seein'
It's her voice that keeps on haunting me, yeah

Send her, send her my love
Roses never fade
Memories remain
Send her, send her my loveHere I stand so patiently
For your lights to shine on me
For your song inside of me
This we bring to you

In the shadow of love
Time goes by, leavin' me helpless
Just to reach and try to live my life
These are my reasons

So here we stand so patiently
For your song inside of me
For your lights to shine on me
This we bring to you

One, one, in a million
Ohh, ohh owh owh owh
Ohh owh owh ohh
Owh owh ohh

So here we stand so patiently
For your song inside of me
For your lights to shine on me
This we bring to youI bet you, she's the one
Who helped you, come undone
Those changes she put you through
Long long distance, you're overdue

I bet you, she'd like to say
She's changed you, in every way
She's so sure, now she's on the run
She ran a red light, you jumped the gun

Chain reaction, shades of passion
We surrender, lose control

So now you, lived a mystery
You won't be just one more casualty
You stumble, before you fall
Won't be the last time, no not at all

In motion, it's on her way
The red light, somebody's got to pay
Those changes she put you through
Long long distance, you're overdue

Chain reaction, shades of passion
We surrender, lose control
Chain reaction, strange attraction
Love's a viper, steals your soul

So now just where do we go?
Tell me where?

Chain reaction, shades of passion
We surrender, lose control
Chain reaction, strange attraction
Love's a viper, steals your soulLying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me, open arms

Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me, open armsJourney
Trial By Fire
When You Love A Woman
In my life I see where I've been
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
My searchin' ain't over.....over
I know that
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting
somewhere.....oh yeah

You've got some fascination
With your high expectations

Won't be up to the one who cares
As you search the embers
Think what you've had, remember

Hang on, don't you let go now
You know, with every heartbeat, we love
Nothing comes easy

Trial By Fire
If He Should Break Your Heart
Please be wrong
Please don't tell Me it's really You
Tell me eyes... Tell my heart what I'm goin' through
I believed I delieved I was over you

(chorus)
If he should break your heart
I'll always know where you are
If you should fall... apart
I'll be there, I'll be around
If he should break.. your heart

I'll be there
Is this right
I don't care I'm alone with you
Here we are, once again you've got someone new
Lonely hands, please don't go what you wanna do

One more night alone, without the touch... of you
If he should break your, if he should break your
If he should break your heart

(repeat chorus)

I'll be there, I'll be aroundThe mist is slowly lifting
The sound of life misplaced your mind
You're sitting, spellbound throughout time
I hope that you remember what you find
Singin' for the lifetime, yea

You put it down, all that I'm thinking
But take a long and distant search,
When all is right you take for granted
You can't look down but you're no worse, no no no no, my my my
My my my my my my my my my
Singin' for the lifetime

The countless visions that are drifting
The silver dreams, you hate to lose
There's no harm, we've all been waiting
Well keep your faith, do what you choose
Singin' for the lifetime, yeaTwo different worlds collide
Somehow come together
Caught in the moment
Blind with desire
The way I wanted you
I should've known better
Movin' way too fast
We jumped into the fire

I can't regret you
Somewhere we went wrong
I won't forget you
Long after you've gone

Oh, you're still in my wildest dream
Getting the best of me
The way you used to do
Tell me, do
Do you still think of me
The way I could make you feel
When love was all we knew
In my wildest dream

We had our time to shine
Before we started fadin'
Could not see eye to eye
Pretended nothing's wrong
We opened up our eyes and our sweet love was gone

I still think about you
And how you've been
Getting by without you
Until you come again

Oh, you're still in my wildest dream
Getting the best of me
The way you used to do
Tell me, do
Do you still think of me
The way I could make you feel
When love was all we knew
In my wildest dream

And on a bed of roses
Under the pale moonlight
Wait for sweet surrender
Until another night

Oh, you're still in my wildest dream
Getting the best of me
The way used to do
Tell me, do
Do you still think of me
The way I could make you feel
When love was all we knew
In your wildest dream

Can't get you off my mind, oh
In a wildest dream
Can't get you off my mind, oh
In your wildest dream, oh

Ooh, a wildest dream
Oh, oh, oh
Come on, come on
