On The Dark Side
Written and originally performed by John Cafferty & The Beaver Brown Band
A #7 Top 40 hit from 1984
Song was used in the movie Eddie and the Cruisers

The dark side's callin' now, nothin' is real
She'll never know just how I feel
From out of the shadows she walks like a dream
Makes me feel crazy, makes me feel so mean

Ain't nothin' gonna save you from a love that's blind
When you slip to the dark side you cross that line
On the dark side, oh yeah
On the dark side, oh yeah

Boardwalk Angel
Little girl, tonight baby don't be blue
Dig those pretty lights along the avenue
You're out there on your own, 
Spending all your time alone
So come on girl, tonight I want to be with you

The world has let you down and it broke your huart
But tonight's the night for a brand new start
We'll leave the world behind
We'll go walking on down the line
Come on girl, let's make our dream comw true

Meet me out on the boardwalk tonight
Meet me down by the sea
We can dance in the carnival lights
On the shores of Jersey
We'll fall in love on a carousel
Little boardwalk angel

Boardwalk angel, boardwalk angel
Boardwalk angel
I want you to stay by me
You're my boardwalk angelBeaver Brown Band

Open Road
As I ride this lonesome highway
The desert wind across my face
My mind slowly wanders
To another time….another place

When the world was so much younger
With no reason to hold back
And we weren’t so afraid of losing
All the things we’d never had

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

Baby we belong together
If I had you by my side
Meet my out tonight
On the open road

Your had a dream you once believed in
That burned inside you like a fire
And that big wheel kept on turning
Somehow that dream it passed you by

Now that fire just keeps on burning
Leaves only hunger and desire
Gotta find yourself a new dream
And leave the rest behind

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

Baby we belong together
If I had you by my side
Meet my out tonight
On the open road

Somewhere over the horizen
Where the darkness meets the light
We’ll marry all our dreams together
Out on this open road tonight

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

Baby we belong together
If I had you by my side
Meet my out tonight
On the open road

Those days are gone forever
Time to kiss the past goodbye
Meet me out tonight
On the open road

On the open road
On the open road
On the open roadBeaver Brown Band

Emotional Storm
Bad moon on the horizon
Something in the air today
Hear the sound of thunder
And the rhythm of a driving rain

Just keep your body moving
Make it thu another day
Everything you ever wanted
Stays just another dream today

Well you feel a little lonely
Never asked this world for much
Baby won’t you move a little closer
Lets see what happens when we touch

It’s an emotional storm
Raining down over you
It’s an emotional storm
Baby what we’re going thru

When you ain’t got no money
This town can get a little rough
And you give what you got now
Somehow its never good enough

At times it’s hard to tell difference
Between what you know as right and wrong
You’re too scared to make the bad move
But you been hungry just a little too long

Well you feel a little lonely
Never asked this world for much
Baby won’t you move a little closer
Lets see what happens when we touch

It’s an emotional storm
Raining down over you
It’s an emotional storm
Baby what we’re going thru

(solo)

It’s an emotional storm
Raining down over you
It’s an emotional storm
Baby what we’re going thru

It’s an emotional storm
Raining down over you
It’s an emotional storm
Baby what we’re going thru

It’s an emotional stormBeaver Brown Band

Tender Years
When the moon hung soft and low,
Catchin' stardust in the light
You held me closer and closer
There was magic in the night

A sweet love song, a melody
that I still can recall
Two young hearts filled with dreams
To walk away with it all

Whoa, whoa tender years
Won't you wash away my tears
How I wish you were here
Please don't go, tender years

A summer love, a beach romance
Salted kisses in the sand
Two young hearts filled with fire
Lost in never-neverland.

Whoa, whoa tender years
Won't you wash away my tears
How I wish you were here
Please don't go, tender yearsBeaver Brown Band

Just A Matter Of Time
There was a time
You had no need for rhythm
or rhyme
And the world seemed so wild
and so free
You just wrapped yourself up
in a dream
all you had to do was believe
and nothin’ was out of your reach
so sure how it all falls in line
it’s just a matter of time
it’s just a matter of time

then you wake up one day
all your dreams somehow
faded away
the road that you followed
I turned
You can’t find where the
fire once burned
can’t look yourself straight
in the eyes
in your heart of hearts…
you’ve compromised
baby one day…we’ll all cross
that line
it’s just a matter of time
it’s just a matter of time

all alone in the still of the night
you come face to face with
your pride
and how much you wanted
it all
you can’t believe now you’re
taking the fall

then you reach out one day
to the light of a new
dawning day
and you take just one small
grain of sand
right into the palm of your hand
and maybe you find in the end
you’re able to dream….
Once again
and baby you fall back in line
it’s just a matter of time
it’s just a matter of timeBeaver Brown Band

Garden Of Eden
It was the garden of edan
The beginning of time
Adam said to eve
Little girl I wanna make you mine

Eve said now wait a minute
Big boy
Not so fast
I wanna think this over
I want a love that’s gonna last

Then eve said to adam
Catch me if you can
It’s been the same old story
Ever since the world began

Honey I’ll give you anything
In this great big world
She said forget those rotten apples
I’ll take some diamonds and some pearls
He said honey I don’t quite know
Exactly what you mean
She said ever since she could remember
She’s had this pretty dream

Then eve said to adam
Catch me if you can
It’s been the same old story
Ever since the world began

He said I got a hungry feelin
And my blood is runnin’ hot
I don’t know what it is I want
I just know its something you got

Eve said come here little boy
Come and sit beside my fire
Wrap yourself around my finger
And I’ll cook your desire

Eve said look here adam honey
I got a reputation to protect
If you want my love and kisses
It’s gonna take a little respect

Adam fell down on his knees
And he looked up in the sky
He said I think I get the picture lord
There’s more to all this than meets the eye

Then eve said to adam
Catch me if you can
It’s been the same old story
Ever since the world beganBeaver Brown Band

(Keep My Love) Alive
out beyond that blue horizen
lies the yet untold tales of our lives
where the river runs wild and deep
and the mountains kiss the sky

the highest moutain I will climb
and I will survive
cause you keep my love alive
yea yea yea
you keep my love alive

a man must find his own reason
to lead his way out of the dark
and I’m searching for some lost key
to unlock these chains from my heart

Into the open fire I’ll ride
And I will survive
Cause you keep my love alive
All you gotta do
Is just keep my love alive

somewhere along the way
I slipped into the shadows of doubt
Now as I stand at these crossroads
I know I’ve come too far to turn back now

Into the open fire I’ll ride
And I will survive
Cause you keep my love alive
All you gotta do
Is just keep my love alive

All you gotta do
Is just keep my love alive
Yea yea yea
You keep my love alive

Into the open fire I’ll ride
And I will survive
Cause you keep my love aliveBeaver Brown Band

Maryia
She walks on the beach
Man she looks so fine
Kisses sweeter than cherry wine
She’s got that devil-look in her eyes
You best believe boy
You’ pay that price

But when she walks
She walks with me
Makes me so blind
I don’t wanna see the light
I just wanna see her tonight

Maryia…won’t you say you will
Maryia…you give me such a chill
Maryia…you know you’re just like the wind
You fill my sails and then
You blow me away
Hey…pretty mayria

All the boys now we got a creed
Ain’t no women ever make you bleed
Tell the boys now I’m tryin to stay cool
This little girl she breaks all the rules

Her pretty lies make me feel sad
But I still want her…and I
Want her bad tonight
‘cause when she holds me tight

Maryia…won’t you say you will
Maryia…you give me such a chill
Maryia…you know you’re just like the wind
You fill my sails and then
You blow me away
Hey…pretty mayria
She’s a women
She can make my blood run cold
She’s a women
Give me shivers down to my soul
Her heart of stone
She can’t control
I just can’t leave her alone

Hey little girl now the night’s so long
We could walk it right through the dawn
I’m wearin’ my heart out on my sleeve
Hey little girl what you do to me

Her pretty lies make me feel sad
But I still want her…and I
Want her bad tonight
Just want to hold you tight

Nyc Song
Hey little girl take me by the hand
Walk with me down this boardwalk
Once last time again
I wanna see those pretty pier lights
I wanna hear those carnival sounds
I wanna stop right at the top again
When the ferris wheel goes round

Well you say that I’ve been restless
And you don’t understand
Tomorrow I’ll be leavin’ on that
Morning train
I gotta leave this candy apple town behind
I gotta get out while I still can
I’m going to New York City
With this guitar in my hand

I’ve been wishin on these stars too long
I’ve been playin’ in these bars too long
I’ve been hold up in your arms too long
I’ve been a prisoner of my heart too long

I’m goin’ to New York City
Gotta find out where I stand
And I’ll be walking down broadway
With this guitar in my hand

Well I sing for the tourists
‘bout a dream life on the water
but when the dream it gets broken
this life gets harder and harder
I gotta leave this candy apple town behind
I gotta get out while I still can
I’m going to New York City
With this guitar in my hand


I’ve been wishin on these stars too long
I’ve been playin’ in these bars too long
I’ve been hold up in your arms too long
I’ve been a prisoner of my heart too long

Pride & Passion
I don’t run for the money honey
It don’t mean a thing
and the power and the glory
never ever made a man a king
and I don’t need to ride
in a long black limousine
I don’t even need to see my picture
On the cover of a magazine

I just need a little satisfaction
And it hits me like a chain reaction
Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all

I don’t need to read my name
All over the front page news
Better save your ink….mister
‘cause I ain’t got no use

maybe you could say that I’m
that I’m just another prisoner of love
it’s the only thing I know for sure
to help me rise above

I just need a little satisfaction
And it hits me like a chain reaction
Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all

And it burns like a fire
And I feel it take me higher
It gets down under my skin
Makes me wanna give that wheel a spin


I just need a little satisfaction
And it hits me like a chain reaction
Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all


Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it all
Talkin’ bout the pride and passion
And the thrill of it allBeaver Brown Band

Runnin Thru' The Fire
I got smokestack lightning
Runnin’ right thru my veins
Trouble hangin’ round my neck
Like a ball & chain

Gotta be more than this to
Being alive
Everyday just spittin’ out nine to five
Every night runnin’ all over this town
Comin’ home feelin’ no pain

I got a hunger and cold desire
Someday it’s gonna take me
higher
just another small flame
runnin’ thru the fire
just another small flame
runnin’ thru the fire

runnin thru the fire….it’s
gonna get hot
runnin’ thru the fire…ready
or not
runnin’ thru the fire…any
way your turn
runnin’ thru the fire….your
gonna get burned

I’m rollin’ down the alleyway
Headin’ for the neon lights
I got a soul full of stuggle
And I need a little mercy
Tonight

This world’s asking just a little
Too much
Honey I need a lovin’ tender touch
Just move your body close to mine
Make everything alright
I got a hunger and cold desire
Someday it’s gonna take me higher
Just another small flame
runnin’ thru the fire
just another small flame
runnin’ thru the fire


runnin thru the fire….it’s
gonna get hot
runnin’ thru the fire…ready
or not
runnin’ thru the fire…any
way your turn
runnin’ thru the fire….your
gonna get burned

Some Like It Hot
I got a hot rod ford
I got a line that can’t miss
But you just pretend
Like I don’t exist
I got that fever
For your sweet kiss
Honey lets be lovers
On a night like this

Don’t you play too cool
Don’t get too smart
Just give it what you got
Some like it hot

When I call you up on the telephone
And I know you’re sittin’
Home all alone
I get that fire
Burnin’ in my soul
Won’t you let me in
To that heart of stone

Don’t you play too cool
Don’t get too smart
Just give it what you got
Some like it hot

I know that your pretendin’
Don’t you leave me in the cold
Just put your hand in my hand
On your mark…get ready…
Set go

Baby come right here
Don’t you run away
Just a little bit closer
Don’t you be afraid
Honey I’m your fool
But I ain’t no saint
So don’t be cruel
You know I just can’t wait

Don’t you play too cool
Don’t get too smart
Just give it what you got
Some like it hot

Baby won’t you meet me
On a midnight rendezvous
Won’t you say you want me
You know girl I want you

I want to take you out
To a movie show
And honey we can sit
In the very last row
And when they turn those
Lights way down low
I’ll take you in my arms
And never let you go

Don’t you play too cool
Don’t get too smart
Just give it what you got
Some like it hot
Just give it what you got
Some like it hot
Just give it what you got
Some like it hot
