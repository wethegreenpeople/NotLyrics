Is the answer none of the above?
Crouched in a hole like a mud-streaked fugitive
Every day a different version of
Pouring it away like water through a sieve

Hey, better realize my friend
Lord in the end, now you can't take it with
Gotta live

If only for a second
I see it twinkling in your eye, gotta try

Well, it's flesh and blood and camouflage
Into the wall, now something's gotta give
Just another act of sabotage
Seen through the haze of a mind-rot sedative

When will you realize my friend?
Lord in the end, now you can't take it with
Gotta live

If only for a second
I see it twinkling in your eye, gotta try

The world that you're forsaking
Is surely more than just a lie, gotta try, yeah

Hey, better realize my friend
Lord in the end, now you can't take it with
Gotta live

If only for a second
I see it twinkling in your eye, gotta try

The world that you're forsaking
Is surely more than just a lie, gotta try

It's all there for the taking
And you don't need to justify, gotta try

Every day is a different version ofWhat on earth is goin' on in my heart?
Has it turned as cold as stone?
Seems these days I don't feel anythin'
'Less it cuts me right down to the bone
What on earth is goin' on in my heart?

'Cause my oh my, you know just don't stop
It's in my mind, I wanna tear it up
And tryin' to fight it, tryin' to turn it off
But it's not enough
It takes a lotta love
It takes a lotta love my friend
To keep your heart from freezin'
To push on till the end
My oh my

What on earth is goin' on in my head?
You know I used to be so shy
You know I used to be so definite
Thought I knew, what love was for
I look around these days
I'm not so sure
No, na na

My oh my, you know it just don't stop
It's in my mind, I wanna tear it up
And tryin' to fight it, tryin' to turn it off
But it's not enough
It takes a lotta love
It takes a lotta love my friend
To keep your heart from freezin'
To push on till the end

My oh my, you know I just can't win
I burn it down it comes right back again
What kinda world is this we're livin' in?
Where you never win
It takes a lotta love
It takes a lotta love these days
To keep your heart from freezin'
To keep your spirit free
Ahh, my oh my

My oh my, you know it just don't stop
It's in my mind, I wanna tear it up
And tryin' to fight it, tryin' to turn it off
But it's not enough
It takes a lotta love
It takes a lotta love my friend
To keep your heart from freezin'
To push on till the end

And my oh my, you know it just don't stop
My oh my, you know it just don't stop
Just don't
My oh my, you know it just don't stop
My oh my
My oh my, you know it just don't stop
My oh my
My oh my, you know it just don't stop
Whey
My oh my, you know it just don't stop
My oh my now, my oh my
My oh my, you know it just don't stop
My oh my, you know it just don't stopMeet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
See you on the other side

Honey, now if I'm honest, I still don't know what love is
Another mirage folds into the haze of time recalled
And now the floodgates cannot hold
All my sorrow all my rage, a tear that falls on every page

Meet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side

Maybe I oughta mention was never my intention to harm you or your kin
Are you so scared to look within, the ghosts are crawling on our skin
We may race and we may run, well not undo what has been done
Change the moment when it's gone

Meet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side

I know it would be outrageous to come on all courageous
And offer you my hand to pull you up on to dry land
When all I got is sinking sand, the trick ain't worth the time it buys
I'm sick of hearing my own lies and love's a raven when it flies

Meet me on the other side
Meet me on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side

And, honey, now if I'm honest
I still dont know what love isWink, wink and the moments gone
Wink, wink and the moments gone
Wink, wink and the moments gone
Wink, wink and the moments gone

And then the doorbell rings
Somebody asks you could
You spare a little time
To feel the weight that's mine

To lower down your guard
Yeah, that your heart gets snagged
Caught in the wheels and dust dragged
Dangled o'er the edge, breathe

You feel you're in too deep
So offer up some crumb
And drop it in the tin
Then slither back within

Your crenelated wealth
Your educated self
Your family your rude health

And all the joy it brings
Aren't we forgetting something?
Feet out on the ledge, feet on the ledge
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, hey

Then in the heat of noon
It finds you like some dog
Got parked up in a field
Hermetically sealed

And scratching at the windshield
And howling at the glass
At anyone might walk past

Were you not aware?
Were you not aware?
Were you not aware?
Breathe, the sea of broken lives

Mechanics doctors housewives
Feet out on the ledge
Feet out on the ledge
Feet out on the ledge
Breathe, breatheThree days spent staring at your photograph
Read your letter made me laugh
But there's a shadow on the path
Till I know, if your love is real

'Cause it's not as if a lot was said
Falling in and falling out of bed
But now the worlds turned on its head
Till I know, if your love is real

Spent a long time now persuading myself
That I don't need no one, nobody else
That I'd felt all there was to feel
I'm in a daydream now I'm out to lunch

And should it come down to the crunch
I'm wide open for that sucker punch

Till I know if your love is real
Till I know if your love is real

Spent a long time now persuading myself
That I don't need no one, nobody else
And who I was, I could conceal

I know if I should live one hundred years
I'd never see another face like yours
On stranger seas or brighter shores
'Cause I know that my love is realLike a bird upon release
Through the atmosphere
Like a honking flock of geese
Winter drawing near

As the fabric comes unstitched
Hearts and minds and eyes bewitched
Standing, watching for the smoke to clear

First chance I get, I'm gone

Moses had his tablets, yeah
Noah had his ark
But all I got's a haystack needle
Stabbing in the dark

Anguished cries and old footfalls
Coming through these paper walls
Need some action, all you get is talk

First chance I get
I'm gone, I'm outta here
First chance I get
I'm gone, I'm outta here

Here's one for the boys back home
Here's one for your spokes
A little taste of victory
To send back to your folks

Here's one for the fireside
Grinning groom, the blushing bride
Come and feast your eyes upon the hoax

First chance I get
I'm gone, I'm outta here
First chance I get
I'm gone, I'm outta here

Over Lake Superior
And the Arctic Sea
Through the dark interior
The stolen territory

I want it with the cream on top
One more lifetime swallowed up
He'll be back, yeah, just you wait and see

First chance I get
I'm gone, I'm outta here
First chance I get
I'm gone, I'm outta here

First chance, first chance
I'm outta here
First chance, first chance
I'm outta here

It's a long way back from where you are
It's a long way back from where you are
It's a long way back from where you are
It's a long, it's a long, it's a longSlow voices speakin' through a hurricane
Said that I wanted but I lied
You're looking good, hey man, I can't complain
Ghost on the road at night

Seen him out walking he's just skin and bones
I don't see nothin' in her eyes
Some call it Hell, felt like a home from home
I'm dreaming different skies

I don't know where I, I don't know what I
Supposed to do now, get it on all night
I don't know where I, I don't know what I
It seemed to me boy that you're doing all right
I don't know where I, I don't know what I
Long way to go now, keep it all inside

36 hours but my mind is fresh
Live for the moment then I'm gone
Suck on that sympathy and feel the rush
Go on my blue eyed son

I don't know where I, I don't know what I
Supposed to do now, get it on all night
I don't know where I, I don't know what I
It seemed to me boy that you're doing all right
I don't know where I, I tell you would I
Long way to go now, keep it all inside

I don't know where I, I don't know what I
Supposed to do now, get it on all night
I don't know where I, I don't know what I
It seemed to me boy that you're doing all right
Don't know where I, don't know what I
Long way to go now, keep it all inside'Neath an avalanche, soft as moss
I am a creeping and intangible sense of loss
I'm the memory you can't get out your head
If I leave you now
You'll wish you were somewhere else instead

I'm the manta ray, I'm the louse
I am the photograph
They found in your burned out house

I am the sound of money
Washing down the drain
I am the pack of lies
Baby, that keeps you sane

Gates of heaven are open wide
God, help me, baby, I'm trapped inside
Feels like I'm buried alive

I'm the bottom line of the joke
I am ecstasy, spilling like bright egg yolk
I'm the thoughts you're too ashamed to ever share
And I am the smell of it
You're trying to wash out of your hair

Gates of heaven are open wide
God, help me, baby, I'm lost inside
Feels like I'm buried alive

Possibilities limitless
Just give me something that's more than this
One shot and I'll never miss, yes

I'm the babe that sleeps through the blitz
I am a sudden and quite unexpected twist
I am your one true love who sleeps with someone else
I am your nemesis, baby, I'm life sweet life itself
Yeah, yeahFriday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turnin' over TV stations
Situations runnin' through my head

Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool to open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowds I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream

Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid to show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

And if you want it come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was giving you was
Never in doubt

Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your hear, let go your head
And feel it now

Babylon
Babylon
Babylon

Sunday all the lights of London
Shining sky is fading red to blue
I'm kickin' through the autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to

Turning back for home you know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

And if you want it come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was giving you was
Never in doubt

Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now

Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now

Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now

Babylon
Babylon
Babylon
Babylon
Babylon
Ba aaaIf I lean my weight on it
If I fix my heart to the line
Might find a way from it
To some easy time

My skins all white with it
I'm up so high when I fall
I fall so far from it
Ain't nowhere at all

Early morning sun
Shine it and I'm gone
To plane out and on the lake
Hey hey, yeah yeah

To glide out on the wing
Turn around and sing
The fear now taking hold
Hey hey, yeah
I'll bring you love but it's all been sold

My heads all wired with it
My tongue gets tied when I speak
The space inside roaring
When that signal break

Early morning sun
Shine it and I'm gone
To plane out and on the lake
Hey hey, yeah yeah

To glide out on the wing
Turn around and sing
The fear now taking hold
Hey hey, yeah
I'll bring you love but it's all been soldThe dawn in all its majesty
Is stealing me away
The dawn in all its honesty
Is turning me to clay

And through the bears of iron rain
Way beyond and back again
I hear the voice of Eden cry
Lift me up, I'm walking on high

It's real love
Real love

This world in all its clarity
Is glorious, is fake
This world in all its vanity
Is more than I can take

And down the road the iron wheels
Chain my heart to how it feels
I hear the voice of Eden cry
Lift me up I'm walking on high

It's real love
Real love
It's real love
Real love
Make it real
Make it real

Well, love now

And something in the heart of me
Is telling me it's time
To meet the eye of destiny
And leave it all behind

And through my bones an iron rage
Paints my soul upon the page
I hear the voice of eden cry
Lift me up to walk on high
Make me wanna lay down and die

Its real love
Real love
Real love
Real love

The dawn in all its majesty
Is stealing me awayI'm like a jackdaw, cawing at your back door
Scratching at your windowpane
Hey, throw your window wide
And taste the April night with me again

Girl, we been veering backwards
Disappearing down into the murky deep
Baby come on, we'll be a long time gone
That's time enough for sleep

And hey, now don't run and hide
Your little heart away
If it's gone we'll sure never find it
Pining for lost innocence

Our hammers beating hard against
That old facade, some other air to breathe
That we might break these molds
And free our restless souls, start to believe

That we can rise above
Our pettiness and love like we ain't loved before
Free on this earth as the surf that rolls
And crashing on the shore

And hey, now don't run and hide
Your little heart away
If it's gone we'll sure never find it
Pining for lost innocence

Tantalizingly I saw
Our shadows moving through the door
Traces from a different time
When I was yours and you were truly mine, all mine

And I still want you, yeah
And I still want you, yeah
And I still want you, yeah
And I still want you, yeah

I still want you, yeah
I still want you, yeah
I still want you, yeah
I still want you

And hey, now don't run and hide
Your little heart away
If it's gone I'll sure never find it

Pining for lost innocence
Pining for lost innocence
Pining for lost innocenceThe hour is out of joint
The black sun has risen
And the river of words
Is flowing on through
The cages of tradition

And they're handing out emptiness
Well, take it 'cause it's given
Free with this plastic innocence
And these standards of living

And questions lighted questions
Burnin' holes into my head
Hanging like shadows over the sun
Staring out like the eyes of the dead

And sometimes my soul flickers
When the wind of change blows cold
Over the mire of repetition
Down the corridors of Rigmarole

What I say, what I think
What I put down in ink
I'm only trying to find
A way to understand

And I mean no harm
I'm just searching for calm
In the storm of mankind

And do you find it there in the sea of faces
That drowns you everyday
Or in the silence and rubble and empty spaces
Where children and Rottweiler play

Is it buried in the praise given so cheap
With a meaningless movement of the jaws
In the looking glass that flatters you
Or in the rattle of hollow applause

Blind circle, moon and sun body willing, mind undone
One pain ending while another begins
Lies, ruin disease into wounds like these
Let the truth sting

From the hub to the limit
Through the urban hollows
Out into the poles of the extreme

To echo through the numbness
Of these godless minutes
In the shadow of delusions regime

And here watching the night
It opens like a flower
The day starts to rust
Time pound a silent hammer
On his empire of dust

And I'm thinking 'bout the bullet
And the TV screen, the dollar and the clenched fist
And if were searching for peace
How come we still believe
In hatred as the catalyst

Oh, through the borderline in front and behind
One pain ending while another begin
Lies, ruin disease into wounds like these
Let the truth sting, yeah
Let the truth

And I feel it from the pit of my stomach
Into the ditch of my mind
Inside the chambers of my heart
As I stare half blind

At these walls of cardboard
At this space that I've rented
At your beauty that is crumbling
Though you try so hard to prevent it

Oh, on and on body willing, mind undone
One pain ending while another begins
Lies, ruin, disease into wounds like these
Let the truth sting

Let the truth sting
Let the truth sting
Let the truth stingAll of my senses overthrown
By the might of your skin
And the lamplight on your cheek bone
Drawing me further in

No sentence I can speak for the wonder so unique
Breaking like a wave upon the shore
Mercy me, I'm falling free
Since you opened up the door

See how the sky is made of sapphire
The colors flowing through our hands
The moon is fire in your hair
A million miles beyond what science understands

Smell that mountain heaven
Although I don't remember ever
Feeling like this before
Mercy me, I'm falling free
Since you opened up the door

And if every window pane should shatter
If every wall should fall apart
Well, it might hurt a bit but wouldn't it matter
With this diamond in my heart

There's no need to nail it to the ground
There's no need to smother it with sense
Just listen to the rhythm of your heart
That pounds and trust it all to chance

'Cause we're standing face to face
With the Angel of Grace
And don't it just taste so pure

Mercy me, I'm falling free
Mercy me, I'm falling free
Mercy me, I'm falling free
Since you opened up the doorPlease forgive me if I act a little strange
For I know not what I do
Feels like lightning running through my veins
Everytime I look at you
Everytime I look at you

Help me out here, all my words are falling short
And there's so much I want to say
Want to tell you just how good it feels
When you look at me that way
When you look at me that way

Throw a stone and watch the ripples flow
Moving out across the bay
Like a stone I fall into your eyes
Deep into their mystery
Deep into some mystery

I got half a mind to scream out loud
I got half a mind to die
So I won't ever have to lose you girl
Won't ever have to say goodbye
I won't ever have to lie
Won't ever have to say goodbye

Please forgive me if I act a little strange
For I know not what I do
Feels like lightning running through my veins
Everytime I look at you
Everytime I look at you
Everytime I look at you
Everytime I look at youSail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now

Crazy skies all wild above me now
Winter howlin' at my face
And everythin' I held so dear
Disappeared without a trace

Oh all the times I've tasted love
Never knew quite what I had
Little darling if you hear me now
Never needed you so bad
Spinnin' round inside my head

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now

I've been talkin' drunken gibberish
Fallin' in and out of bars
Tryin' to get some explanation here
For the way some people are
How did it ever come so far?

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
Sail away with me honey
Now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, now

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hand
You break me up if you pull me down
Woh ohh
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now
Now, nowTake this silver lining
Keep it in your own sweet head
And shinin' when
The night is burnin' red
Shine it in the twilight
Shine it on the cold, cold ground
Shine it till these walls come
Tumbling down

We were born with our
Eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why?

Time after time
They drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep

Step into the silence
Take it in your own two hands
And scatter it like diamonds
All across this land
Yeah, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

Blazin' in the morning
Wearin' like an iron skin
Only things worth livin' for
Are innocence and magic
Amen

We were born with our
Eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why?

Time after time
They drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep

We were born with our
Eyes wide open
So alive with wild hope now
Can you tell me why?

Time after time
They drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep
Know that the light don't sleep

Time after time
They drag you down
Down in the darkness deep
Fools in their madness all around
Know that the light don't sleep
Know that the light don't sleepFriday night, I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head

Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool, to open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

If you want it, come and get it
For crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was never in doubt

Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now

Babylon, Babylon

Saturday, I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowds I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing in my bloodstream

I only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid, to show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

If you want it, come and get it
For crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was never in doubt

Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now

Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart, let go your head
And feel it now

Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
Babylon, BabylonWhat are you becoming? What have you become?
Once you sang your own song
Now you're dancing to the same drum
What have you become?

And what is that you're wearing?
Money's ugly confidence
You sacrificed the poem of your imagination
For these pounds and pence

Me, I take the cynic's role
Throw scorn on your empty mind
I've seen this monotonous world
Make dull what used to shine
You lost interest, you lost your spine
Oh, that spine, fine, fine

When there' nothing left
On this plate you're handed
You find yourself running the gauntlet
Of all of these double standards
It's very thin ice over which you're skating
And after this black winter, the thaw

So what are you?
Tell me, tell me what are you
And what have you becomeCan't recall the moment when the doubt
Ripped your face
Or put my finger on quite when the fog
Took your place

Now we've been beating on it 'til we're black and blue
Just what good exactly is it gonna do
Always so much harder
So much harder when you have to try

Could we at least agree upon the size
And the shape?
The relative dimensions that the lie
Ought to take

For your delectation a scenario
Taken so much further than it need to go
Always so much harder, always so much
If we could get away just for a week or two

Baby, let it burn the way it used to do
Always so much harder
So much harder when you have to try
Have to try

And if the ground should open up
And swallow me, it would not stop
That minute hand from ticking off
The minutes 'til the penny drop

Not a breath of wind and not a cloud
In the sky
All the better then to watch the world passing by
Passing by, yeah, passing by, passing byMy good friends speak
Like they did last year
Last night's just a blur
Through a head full of beer

My good friends speak
Like they did last year
And last year's just a blur
Through a head full of beer

Where's your wisdom
Put that broken bottle down
Let the wind in your sails
Take you out of this town so sad

I think I'm dying
And and if life's just a living room
Then I'm in the hall and I'm glad
Oh, if life's just a living room
Then I'm in the hall and I'm glad
Oh, I'm glad, I'm glad

Now the dawn, it has broke
Still the night don't clear
Memories falling in the mornin' rain
I'm up too close to see it clear
And last year's just a blur
Through a head full of beer

And where's your wisdom
Put that broken bottle down
Let the wind in your sails
Take you out of this town so sad

I think I'm dying
And if life's just a living room
Then I'm in the hall and I'm glad
Oh, if life's just a living room
Then I'm in the hall and I'm glad

Oh, if life's just a living room
Then I'm in the hall and I'm glad
Oh I'm glad, I'm gladStella, she gave me a state of grace
I'm armor plated 4 inches thick
Now all I got was a little taste
I'm gibbering like a lunatic

Stella, the artist
Just for now at least you're mine, all mine
No need to be modest as the daylight creeps
Take her hand and reach through time

I felt the sting of my own rebuke
Come spinning back like a boomerang
I swam the sea of psychotic puke
Nursing my love like a guilty pang

Stella, the artist
Just for now at least you're mine, all mine
No need to be modest as the daylight creeps
Take her hand and reach

You're only saying what they all say
You're only saying what they all say
It could be more like the old days
It should be more like the old days, oh, man

Stella, the artist
As the daylight creeps
Take her hand and reach through time

Stella, the artist
Just for now at least you're mine, all mine
No need to be modest as the daylight creeps
And the floorboard creaks and your poor heart leaps
Take her hand and reach through timeIt's a sad old world that's turning tonight
As I slide through the streets
Moonlight and memory burning
And in my hand your broken dream

My watery eyes, I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

All these useless emotions churning round
As I search these bare walls for a clue
And all the time the truth is flashing in my mind
That's when a heart gets broken
There's nothing you can do

My watery eyes, I sing for you this lullaby
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

And I'm packing my belongings
Hey, I'll be gone before the noon arrives
'Cos I know there's no use pretending
Soon it'll all be alright

But hey
Let the shadow fall from your window
Let the morning light fill your head
Stand up and let the wild wind blow
Right into your soul till the night is dead

See the dawn break gold
When the night is dead
Hear the bellsThis years love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waitin' on my own, too long
And when ya hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget
How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feelin' like you can't go on

Turning circles, time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me, got to know for sure
'Cos it takes somethin' more this time
Sweet, sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losin' all control
Every dream inside my soul
When ya kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singin' ain't this life so sweet

This years love, it better last
This years love, it better last

'Cos whose to worry
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on
Won't ya kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singin' ain't this life so sweet

This years love, it better last
This years love, it better last

This years love, it better last
This years love, it better last

This years love, it better last
Oh, oh, oh, aah yea
This years love, it better lastFrom the very first moment I saw you
That's when I knew
All the dreams I held in my heart
Had suddenly come true

Knock me over stone cold sober
Not a think I could say or do
'Cause baby when I'm walking with you now
My eyes are so wide

Like you reached right into my head
And turned on the light inside
Turning on the light
Inside my mind hey

Come on baby its all right
Sunday, Monday day or night
Written blue on white its plain to see
Be mine, be mine

Rainy shiny night or day
Whats the difference anyway
Honey till your heart belongs to me

If I had some influence girl
With the powers that be
I'd have them fire that arrow at you
Like they fired it right at me

And maybe when your heart
And soul are burning you might see
That every time I'm talking with you
Its always over too soon

That everyday feels so incomplete
Till you walk into the room
Say the word now girl
I'll jump that moon hey

Come on baby its okay
Rainy shiny night or day
Theres nothing in the way now
Don't you see
Be mine, be mine

Winter summer day or night
Centigrade of Fahrenheit
Baby till your heart belongs to me
Be mine, be mine

Thursday, Friday short or long
When you got a love so strong
How can it be wrong now mercy me
Be mine, be mine

Jumpin' Jesus holy cow
What's the difference anyhow
Baby till your heart belongs to me

Be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine
