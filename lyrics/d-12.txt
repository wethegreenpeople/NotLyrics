I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
{ahhhhhhhh!} guess who slim shady just signed to interscope?
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift i had ten of my boys take her virginity
{mmm mm mmm!} and bitches know me as a horny ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, i ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin up in the urinal (you fuckin homo!)
That's what i said at my dad's funeral

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still (still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed (killed)
That's why we don't call it detroit, we call it amityville ('ville)
You can get capped after just havin a cavity filled (filled)
Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still (still)
This ain't detroit, this is motherfuckin hamburger hill! (hill!)
We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too!
That's the mentality here (here) that's the reality here (here)
Did i just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here?? (huh?)
While i'm holdin a pistol with this many calibres here?? (here??)
Got some registration and just made this shit valid this year? (year?)
Cause once i snap i can't be held accountable for my acts
And that's when accidents happen,
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around and they found you
And your family in it (ahhhhh!)
Got damnit he meant it when he tells you

[swifty:]
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin' bombs on the back of record companies (uh huh)
Blow 'em up if they ain't wantin' me
The national guard- they scared of huntin' me
I love beef- i got your hoe duckin' me
A drug thief- bitch i'll take your marijuana
These slugs will keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggaz in hundred degree saunas
You can act if fool if you wanna- biatch
It's this lyrical piranha- strapped with a grenade in a pool with yo' mama
Attack her by the legs and pull her to the bottom
Twit lettin' up like a condom
Slappin' if you fuckas got a problem
When i see 'em- you hoes endin' up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in a trunk of a black and gold bm
Pull in a garage while you screamin'
Keep the motor on and i'm leavin'
I'll shit on you

I will shit on you i don't care who you are- i'll shit on you

Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family

I'm an alcholic- where's the fuckin' toilet
Pass the hot dog (bizarre, aren't you islamic?)
Bitch shut your fuckin' mouth
I'ma keep eating 'till richard simmonds comes to my house
With a chainsaw to cut me out (my house, my house)
Aww fuck your wife- i had sex since i met her
Too busy fuckin' with- your baby sitter (ha ha ha)
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cooking cleaning and sucking dick- and that's it (i said it)
I'm responsible for killing john candy
Got jonbennet ramsey in my '98 camry (she's lost)
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours- the idoitic bizarre

My adolescent years weren't shit to wait i do know
I never grew up- i was born grown and grew down
The older i get- the dumber the shit i get in
The more ignorant the incident is- i fit in
Ignorin' the shit? how boring it gets when there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit (nope)
I know i'm a bit flaky- but they make me
It's they who hate me and say they can takee (c'mon)
It's they whose legs i break and make achey
It's they who mistake me make me so angry (urgh)
I'll shit on you
I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin'- i said i'll cop a squad on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordeu bleu and straight shit
Like notorious big did to that bitch on the skit on his last album
Pull my pants down and...

Is richard pryor still alive?
If not i'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin' (what?!)
Born brainless this steel ain't stainless
Your blood stains all over this steel god-dangit
Bitch bring it!
These niggaz that i hang with'll hang u up naked by your ankles dangling
But need i stay straight when i don't need your help
If you won't gimmie ya pussy i'll unloosen my belt and (i'll shit on you)
I bet your daddy's not, your momma's kinda caught, your sister's chin crushed
Ya aunt supply ya rocks
Buck fifty 'cross your neck
Blow up your tech
I'll beat you across your chest

[kuniva:]
Yo it's only right i jack the car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun when i'm drunk i run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat your peeps down worse than steve stought
Put you in choke holds i learned last week from the police man
Who caught me stealing weed from his jeep (hey, hey, hey!)
I see hoes fightin' y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like deebo fightin' peabo bryson (uhhh)
I'll shit on you
Fuck what your hollerin' and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggaz get hit with a 2-peace bling bling
With a poisonous thing- i'm such a violent thing

[eminem:]
Once i get on two hits of ex my disc slips and disconnects
'till i walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch that disrespects
I'll shit on you
Over reaction is my only reaction which only sets off a chain reaction
That puts five more zany actin' maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack 10 9 millimeters
5 criminals pullin' heaters and spillin' liters of blood like swimmin' pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it- matter of fact i stand by it
So please stand by at the start of a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet (that's)
Boy girl dog woman man child

I'll shit on you

Ya, till i die from old age
I'll be pulling girls up to suck my dick
Right on stage
So stop talking
Get them old jellies walking

Go in deep cover
Tricking these goofy ass hoes

Your favorite nucka flow butter
Niggas get mobbed

My nine is like a guiding light at night shinin' bright
My fuckin whip is tighter then my wife's vagina sike

Got my smith and wesson
I guess its time to pick a different weapon man that shits depressin
But swift is gettin me a new one for a christmas present

They managed to confiscate the pistol that i brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative baby hold your head up don't u let up

Stand up for what you believe in as long as u breathin

From these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters

An official beater don't let me see you with your heater

I'm hostile with this roscal pointed up your nostrils

Had to learn to strip dance to my boys bachelor party,
She gave me head and broke my bed,
And there's really nothin else to be said

I'm (white), a human mutt, fuck a being
I'm a dog - fuck lambs, i'm silencin 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walkin, talkin, ouija board
Speakin in tongues, i've never spoke this speech before

Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit yo
"is this some kind of sick joke?" shit no, motherfuckin schitzo
So disturbed, he just goes so berzerk he tiptoes
This verse was his urge to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
So-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp
So - lock your doors, drop to the floors

My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store (nigga i'm takin these)
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me)
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And i ain't got no food, my job i've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (i'm sorry) i had to eat it (ohh)
My dick is burnin, it ain't cause of disease
Because i'm jackin off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (ahh!)
I'm livin in waco texas, me and my girl

Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro-gas spiller
Psycho slash michael myers, michael jack's "thriller"
Rifle slash knife faggot that's your "cop killer"
As a yung'un, i was beat where i was livin (aight)
Crossdressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess i was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the ritalin
Pressed stressed and ritalin caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what i did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you bo derek; i throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin to stare at

Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (yea yea!)
My face is pink, lookin for a sink
And don't worry bout what i put in your drink
It's called a date-rape drug, ten minutes you'll be fucked up
Open your nasty-ass legs up (yeah you whore)
Bitches i'm catchin, blunts i'm matchin
Don't call me bizarre, i'm the reverand jesse jackson

It'd be cool if you was askin me some reasonable questions
But you on some bullshit nigga, this yo' last beer (f'real)
Get the fuck off my dick and tell yo' bitch to bring here ass here
I kick a hoe out without givin her cabfare
And leave her barefooted just for naggin in my damn ear
When i'm out eatin, you fags'll interfere
They don't go until i let 'em know a mag' is sittin here

I'm at the front of the bar by the lounge in the back
With a slut on my arm while i'm downin the 'gnac
Got the pills in my system, floatin around
Everytime i start driftin, someone open they mouth
Yo my ear been spit licked and freestyled in

A slow song come on its time to dirty dance
And right now im grabbin any girl i can
Grab her butt cheeks and hold her real tight
And tell her me and you were gettin "wild the night"
Gimme your beeper number and checks before you leave

[kon artis]
Yo, yo, huh, yo, yo, yo
That's right motherfuckers we back
Same slangin, orangatangin, wildin out on hoodrats
They say i act like i'm too famous to say hi
And tell 'em what my name is but really i'm still nameless...
You niggas don't get it yet do you
Dealin out platinum or flop i still put it through you
Wit a luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal wit you in front of st andrew's still?
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until i see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that roll you got
You gon see these (?) niggas that really need some prozac
Fo' sho' that, ask the others
But gator lay you down next to your mother's mother's grandmother

[kuniva]
You know i'm feelin real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight and half the niggas i give dap to i don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it like the next sellin clippers' game
I kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom
You and your madame, it's really unexplainable how i have 'em
Who call theyself screamin about a challenge
Nigga we got a gift while you barely makin it off mere talent
My skills are deeply embedded even your hoe said it
She was knock kneed i fucked her now she's bow legged
In the middle of rappin i drop the mic
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrappin
Kuniva and kon artis my nigga we get it crackin
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughin

[hook: 1- in background]

Now this aint funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen in him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't
Cuz niggas aint fuckin around no more man [repeat]

[swifty mcvay]
The feds can't hold me, i hold feds
I was born wit a dark ass cloud over my head
Rainin acid, you can't refrain from gettin yo' ass kicked
Cuz you talk too much you ask for it
I'm on some massive shit, everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if i was performin at an orgy
These niggas get confronted, then they change stories
I touch you then they thinkin everything is hunky dory
I even have you pour me the gasoline for me
Pullin up slowly, cocktailin' your homie [crash]
You met alotta niggas which you wouldn't wanna know me
Yo' ass might not even make it home wit your rollie
Don't even try, in your system like e coli
Tryin to beef with me, nigga please yo' people die
I'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally
I survived the abortion immediately, surprise! aaaaah!

[eminem]
Picture me sittin in a jail cell rottin
Or barricaded in a motel wit twelve shotguns
So when the cops come knockin each hand's got one
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs
One man army, guns can't harm me
Young and army, worse than my uncle ronnie
Ever since i got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop carryin out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flipped and censorship
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
Ever since i spit some shit on infinite
I been givin it a hundred and ten percent
Cuz when i'm bent most of my energy's spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what i invent is innocent
Twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
Ten's because i love being under your skin
Yeah shit can happen, so stick to rappin
Quit the yappin or i'ma lift the mack and
That can lead to another mishap happenin
Skip the crap get the can of whoopass crackin

It can and it will (nigga)
Fuck around with amityville and you die
Insanity spills from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers in six different bodies
With their personalities split
Fuckin you up wit hit after hit
Stickin you up with clip after clip
Makin you suck dick after dick
Dirty motherfuckin dozen
The kon artis, motherfuckin peter s. bizarre, swifty mcvay, the kuniva
Dirty father fuckin harry
Puttin you down in a cemetery, you get buried
All you of you motherfuckers suck our motherfuckin cocks
We are not playin, we are not playin
We are not bullshittin, this is not a motherfuckin joke...D-12

Ooops i did it again didn't i my shit's harder
To figure out than what britney's tit size is

You know how many shit's i get if i wish i did
So i can quit givin these twisted little kids ideas
This just in, britney just dissed justin
She just fucked ben, got pit fucked and dick sucked him
If (?) can get his ass licked, how i can't shit
Goddamn bitch i'm rich i can't understand this
Are those pictures they made of us together on the internet
As close as i'm ever gonna get to hittin it from the back
And shit when it comes to that i hit harder from the back
Than everlast when he's pluggin lethal in his fuckin ass
Just give me one more chance britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is

Michael jackson sent two helicopters to get me
I'm up early wit my hair curly
Me and mr. furly, fuckin laverne and shirley!

Alotta rappers are livin in la la land
That's why i let my dogs out on the baha men
As bad as a life i had, i'm not mad
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps askin me why i rap wit a honky
But grannie i'm a flunky i could be a junky
I could be hangin with the hoochies out at the club scene

It's sad but i'm glad that i'm made to rhyme
Where you work you aint gettin paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I aint in your light, so stay they hell up outta mine
Y'all the reason why princess diana ended up dyin

Tryin to get us to leave cuz what we say just aint clean (uh, uh)

Now what's these parents all mad for? (your music is bad for 'um)
For teenage kids that drink more than ted danson in cheers
Carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch (shutup!)
Broke or rich, i still do that same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit

Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you cain't do it (ha ha)

Constipated bitch, tell these pigs to back off!
The mind of rapist, denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason, i'm a anus
Walk the street in a "beat it" jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hat shit i put my head on opposite and step backwards
Walkin zombied it's ornery
Pullin armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camraderie

Yo, i can concoct the nine slot, plus i run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, bustin wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standin by, thinkin oh what a mess
Blast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs are dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that bugz done felt
A deranged team, smokin ganja greens
This car beam'll make your fuckin head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the d
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
And when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your [scream]

Stop takin drugs!! i'm tryin
My little boy is dyin, he losin too much iron
And if i die, it won't be because i got shot
It'll be because i tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Takin drugs is cool, that's why i buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass, let your little brother try 'em
Ten years is what i'm facin
Police breakin in my house, lil' bow wow in the basement
(jermaine!) a rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fuckin album comes out
I'm eighteen years old, still shit in the bed
Beaten 'til i'm red, fear nothin but war and bread
It's me again, fuckin dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch when i stick it in
No medication, i'm out of perkasets
I lost my weed, plus my fuckin diaper's wet

Cause i'm quick to snatch a nigga out his polo
I'm the reason nigga's come ten deep and end up leaving solo
Meet losing ya'll nigga's must be bugging
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody even the bitch who gave me cpr
Step to the outz and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of bill clinton's interns

[eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard
So when i feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated while you breathin
Or you'll be leavin the receivin room this evenin with jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin on eight corners swarmin ya hood
With a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
I hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Flotin around drowned face down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up
To the 7 mile drive-through at mcdonald's and piledrive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he drives by me at 90 mph
This place is my house i might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like mase's eyebrows

[fuzz]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips, yeah, she get it
The same way that i fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls i'm passing clothes
You like it in the ass is what i'm askin hoes
Aren't you fuzz he has sold more albums then the jackson's sold
I love you baby if i'm not with you then i'm blastin foes
Telepathly harrasing foes
I know your little sister is four-teen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down titantic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they asking for
Fuzz scooter fucking one man bout to show you passing one blunt
Bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2pac to keep his head up
I went to the fighting really canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like bitch come and pick this bitch up
On battle you be sweeter then i get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause i was high when i wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!
Two pills i pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm clint eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything i come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin
[swifty] bitch it's too late
[eminem] cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew i did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face [blam]
With a fifth in me, when i guzzle remi i do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "forgive me"
I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed i sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin, i make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man march, we gon' fight

[chorus: (eminem)]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit

Slashin your tires, flyin down fenkel and meyers
Plates expired, soon as i'm hired, i'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(hey, is bizarre performing?) bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, richard pryor
(aren't you a male dancer?) nah bitch, i'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, i'm on an acid trip
My dj's in a coma for lettin the record skip.. [needle pops]

I'm fuckin anything when i'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion

I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like i was in vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom

Ayo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin [gun cocks] nigga pass that
In amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'stop the violence' rally, i blast gats
Be your mom on publishin, get your ascap-ped
The kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets, asap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch i snatch shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[kuniva]
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz i'm a "luni"
I got a "yukmouth" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like christmas toys
If i go solo, i'm doin a song with bolo
A big chinese nigga, screamin "kuniva yo yo.."
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats i sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til i got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a kon artis since i was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named carlisle von
Who got fired from ups for tryin to send you a bomb
(special delivery!) i signed to a local label for fun
Say i got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'til i met your fat mama, now i'm rollin in dough

So hey, you ain't gotta be scared to fuck
If you want head, then prepare to suck (do it)

That's why i got a hoe in the back, blowin my sac

Let 'em all bang, run that cheese
Tell that trick nigga (come back please!)

And i holla out the window of the hatch
Where's my scratch? bitch, that's, it
Suck it stroke it make me rich
As a token of my appreciation it's
Another client for you to hit
I don't give a fuck if you gotta go home to the kids
You shoulda picked another occupation trick
Now you're stuck with me, fuck with me
And i'ma slap you up in this truck
You must be out your mind or somethin
Cryin and whinin like you tired or somethin
Go suck some head until it aches for bufferin
You don't work? you make nothin
I'm just another case of a lazy husband

I want the paper stack
Buy you an outfit, then take it back
When you page me bitch i never page you back
You only act a certain way that i make you act (whattup)
Hoes recognize, and niggaz do too
Cause they realize that niggaz do shoot
Don't like a chick that act too cute
Bitch hold my gat down when i shoot hoops (oh yeah)
And don't be askin me, all kind of questions
All harassin me, callin stressin
Or i may have to release some aggression
Beat you to death and teach you a lesson
Lookin for handouts like you my damn spouse
Pull your pants down and fuck my mans now
Shut your damn mouth or get in the damn house
Off with the damn blouse and suck on my damn crotch

So mom, get out there and start sellin yo' dirty ass

Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this two
Sorry officer, i don't care how pissed i get you
But i don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

[swifty mcvay]
Nigga, we violently active, so fuck with us
See i'm backwards - i slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for asking, they must've been wanting to meet the lord
When my parents talk to me they've got mean mugs and ignore
They were snooping through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the forty-four scattered over their porch
Bustin pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Trying to break your neck to conversate? bitch, i'll do it for you
Catch me laughing at your funeral when they lower you, you and your ho
You gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow for any nigga, we'll shower you
Young, black, and powerful, (bitch!) and i ain't gotta lie to you

Stepped in the door waving the four-four
Blazing at po-po, escaping and lay low
They call my (?), but i spit fire
I lit five inside a fucking dickrider
The clip slider, love to blast a mag, you're a fag
You love being ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
Never say that i'm a gangsta, now that's gangsta
Yall niggas sound like jigga but act like pac
Yo, my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gonna put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touching the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew tuck in his chain
You think this shit's a game and we're bluffing for fame?
I'll squeeze off this tech until nothing remains

[kuniva]
The only time that i'm at piece/peace is when i'm close to one
Cause i don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
That's why i'm heated, you never know who starts creepin
Waking you up with aks while you lie sleeping
I'd rather pack the heat and not need
Rather than need one and not have it, i married this glock-matic

You know the sound when i'm spinnin round
Spittin these rounds from fo' pounds
While the whole crowd is screaming as loud
From they're mouths as they possibly allow
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Arial sommersault from ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry the nine where i go
Bullets whistle and hit you while i'm shooting at five-0
Some semi-automatic for static's the motto
Spitting like [columbine kids] from colorado

It'll make jehova's witnesses think before they knock (sorry, sorry!)

It'll make holyfield start fighting
It'll make ma$e say "fuck church!" and go back to writing
It'll make shyne say he sound like biggie smalls
It'll make r. kelly give respect to aaron hall
It'll make christopher reeve start walking
It'll make a dog with no voice suddenly start barking
It'll make a nun turn into a filthy slut
It'll make the hardest pitbull turn into a fucking mutt
It'll make a muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make a redneck start to read the holy koran
It'll make ike stop beating tina
It'll make slim shady fall back in love with christina
Christina aguilera... ha ha ha ha!

I Remember
Your mother!
You fuckin faggot

There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put down the mic and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the house of pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made

But the dumbest thing that he could ever do
Is try to pump a 380 at those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do
Cuz i remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
Kid rock and limp bizkit came along
Now nobody wanna here your old ass sing no more

I remember back when you had the knack
And i remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when i heard the news
I just wish the cardiac would have murderered you
Maybe ice-t is right you are a bitch
You come around when your broke
And leave when your rich

But the dumbest thing that he could ever do
Is try to pump a 380 at those who act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do
Cuz i remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
Kid rock and limp bizkit came along
Now nobody wanna here your old ass sing no more

Remeber back in 94 like right before ms. everlast was whitey ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When house of pain was outta fame
Like some one douced the flame
And maybe they destined never to jump around again
Or ever further back when i first had heard the knack
And you were down with syndicate
I went to get your shit man i was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound rediculous
You dickless piece of shit how could you diss me bitch
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember sway and tech when came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin then you left the room and didnt say goodbye or nuttin
Like you mad cuz some one else is white and tryin rhyme or sumtin
Im sorry man i wasnt tryin to steal your light or nuttin
But your a homo sexual white rappin irish ( )
Man i wish i was irish then i could be a ( ) too
Then i'd be confused as you
And i wouldnt know what to do
Wuts up with you, i never fucked wit you
Why would you fuck with me
Knowing i could rap circles around you
Wut you nutz as me ?
Plus i could sing better then you and i dont fuckin sing
And probably play guitar better and i aint never touched a string
But i aint mad at you i'd hate me to if i was you
Im what your used to be, shit you was me in 92
So ever time i right a lyric im a think of you
And maybe that will help me know what its like to sing the blues

Cuz i remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was
How it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
Kid rock and limp bizkit came along
Now no one wanna here your old ass sing no more

Fuckin faggot sissy, fuck
And by the way 380's a fuckin sissy gun

Hold up hold up i know you didnt just through shit up on this stage
Bitch ass nigga
Fuck me? nigga fuck you

Mother fucking ass niggaI'm goin' to get get my gun

This motherfucker wants to disrespect me?
Em, Em, what the fuck you doing man?
I got something for his ass, calm down, no you calm down
Man, what's you're problem? Fuck that

The motherfucker wants to pop shit to me? Man
He wasn't poppin' shit, you heard him he was poppin' them shit
What shit? That shit, you heard him
He asked for your autograph

A mass murderer, pack burners to blast further then you can get
My shit be shooting through bricks
I mix anything together, I done guillotine a nigger
Keep it heated, I pop clips with 17 or better

I'll be severin' heads, I'm in everyones nightmare
A nigger that can never ever be scared of the FED's
And the niggers that'll fuck with you, stab and brass knuckle you
Then have you in the public, there's nothing that you can do

Enough with you're motherfucking tough talk, you're soft
Get you're balls blew off, from a sawed-off, fa' raw dawg?
Crazier then all y'all , what you like the navy when I'm angry
You'll never catch me hangin' in a NOC's car

All I have is thought of, breathing evil
Desert Eagle's will eat through people
When I see you I'ma heat you're beef slow
Fuck being peaceful, the piece in the vehicle and

(I'm goin' to get get my gun)
This motherfucker's poppin' that shit
Nah fuck that I'll be right back
(I'm goin' to get get my gun)
Nah motherfucker, fuck you
You ain't disrespectin' me like that

(I'm goin' to get get my gun)
Walk to the room, sixteen shot clip
Bitch how you like that?
(I'm goin' to get get my gun)
Bet you ain't know that I'm strapped
Nice one, bitch this is my gat
(I'm goin' to get get my gun)

I bring it to niggers lookin' as if they want trouble
I send they body flippin' around like a stunt double
Forget about the fightin', scrappin', squabing, buckin'
I'll squeeze the piece you jumpin', dodgin', duckin'

Squatin' under trucks and screamin' "That niggers bluffin' "
I cuff my nuts while cussin' "Don't trust him"
I'm round up Runyan, Dave, Wood and Nico
My nigger Big I Jamal lettin' the heat blow

Heat sleep hoes got it in, you're neepo
'Cause you keep shooting at me and missing like Shaq's free-throws
You gotta hit a little closer if you wanna try
Pistol whip a soldier, with a missle on his shoulders

You can fold or blow ya' brick house into some tiny boulders
A grimey older cab will leave you with a tiny odor
I'm doggish, you feelin' frogish, you leap bitch
My car is right across the street bitch and
(I'm goin' to get get my gun)

My whole outfit count clips, get you're house lit the fuck up
You're spouse shit, and you're mouse clip
Betta' watch miscountless slugs I'ma send
Watch you holla when them hollow tips dug threw you're skin

I'm in love with the sin, tell Bugz I'ma see him
When I cock back, right to put your blood on you're friends
Make a run, got a hint, bust a slug on his chin
Ain't going no were like the drugs outta Kim

I'm a psycho icon, the mightful might bomb
Get a eye full of lead when I slight you're lights out
With a street cleaner, wipe you're life out
Bullets flow at you're ears, like a Tyson fight bout

Fuck the night clout, guns, clips
(I'm goin' to get my )
Fuck that, run bitch
Hit the street talks, chumps don't know me
Ain't no profit to be home crowd homie

Dumbass motherfuckers, always gotta come to me
With some dumb shit
Fuckin' I done told this motherfucker
Wassup bitch? Autograph this, oh shit
(I'm goin' to get my gun)

I'm trying to pull the trigger but it's stuck, fuck
My shit is all jammed up, up
C'mon you cock sucking, good for nothing
Mother-fucking piece of shit, shoot, ah

Yeah, wattup bitch? Say that shit again
Shot the bullet missed, hit a brick
Bounced of it ricocheted back in his shin
Went through his bitch on the way back hit his friend

Payback homie, don't play that shit is spin
To be on I told you to leave this shit alone or
(I'm goin' to get my gun)
And it's a shame I'm to drunk to even aim
Denaun stepped in the way and I shot him in his leg

It's like bang, bang, bang nigger pop, pop, pop
Everybody bustin' rounds like they ra, ra, ra
But when you see me in the street, I be like Wassup now?
They bodyguard be steppin' in trying to calm shit down
(Chill out man, chill out)

Fuck that I got a bone to pick, you said it
Then we said that wrestle like some grown man shit
Then we, then we could talk about our problems, couldn't we?
Just shoot a fair one and handled this situation seriously

I guess not, you wanna resort to the heater
So I gotta grab my Mac and my Uzi and my Nina
Step between us and get shot but get separated with the squeeze
You ain't ready for war, Runyan ain't nothing to play with

This motherfucker's poppin' that shit
Nah fuck that I'll be right back
(I'm goin' to get get my gun)
Nah motherfucker, fuck you
You ain't disrespectin' me like that

(I'm goin' to get get my gun)
Walk to the room, sixteen shot clip
Bitch how you like that?
(I'm goin' to get get my gun)
Bet you ain't know that I'm strapped
Nice one, bitch this is my gat
(I'm goin' to get get my gun)

Walk to Rite-Aid for a can of spaghetti
It's been one hour and bitch my photo's ain't ready
Picture's of my dog and my family reunion
It's been two hours and my fuckin' days ruined

Hey, Kate, do you wanna get raped?
Have my pictures on fucking Phillips 38
That's why I don't be fucking battle rapping
'Cause every time I lose, this is what the fuck happens

Back to these pictures I was trying to get developed
This man tried to get in front of me, I wouldn't let him
I'm ready to blow this bitches brains out
I'm nervous, I farted, some shit came out

Times up, shot her with a gun
Got on my cell phone and called Rev. Run
And all this crazy shit I, regret it
All 'cause I wanted to see Elton John naked
