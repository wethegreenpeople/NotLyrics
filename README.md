# NotLyrics
NotLyrics is a Python program to test out Markov chains. When an artist is given to the program, it will download the lyrics, and then generate a fake lyric based out of the composistion of the real lyrics for the artist. 

You can see a very rough example of the program in action at: http://uraqt.xyz/notlyrics

This project was made possibly largely because of the markovify library: https://github.com/jsvine/markovify, and http://www.songlyrics.com/

# Future Goals
I'd like to add async to the program so it doesn't hold everything up when you download lyrics
